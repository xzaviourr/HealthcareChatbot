After the treatment of vaporial alveolar lavage, its alveolar macrophage viabilityIt can be increased, and the study did not find that II cell generated protein increased, and the whole body lipid metabolism has no abnormalities, so it is generally considered that the disease is related to the decline in clearing capacity.\",\n",
       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nPathogenic bacteria is Bordtella, B. Perdush, often known as the 100-day Ethioplast, known to Bobacea has four bacilli, except for Bobs, there is a hundred days of Bobs bacteria (B. Parapertussis), B. Bronchiseptica and B. Avium, bird type Bobia generally does not cause human disease, only causes bird infection, and hundredth and cough About 1.0 ~ 1.5 μm, width of about 0.3 ~ 0.5 μm, capsule, can not exercise, Gram-dyed negative, oxygen, no spores, no flagepan, with a deep colors with benzene blue stained, bacterial culture requires a lot ( 15% ~ 25%) can breed good, so often with Border-gengous medium (i.e., blood, glycerol, potato), and a slow growth of 100-day Ethiococci growth, 35 ~ 37 ° C in a humid environment 3 ~ After 7 days, a small, opaque colonies grow, the initial colonus, smooth, smooth (S) type, also known as the I phase bacteria, high morphology, capsular and strong virulence and antigenicity, Strong disease, such as continuing culture of the separation colonies in ordinary medium, the colony becomes a rough (R) type, called IV phase bacteria, no capsule, virulence and antigenic loss, and lose pathogenic force, II-phase, III phase is intermediate transition type, and hundred-day Ethiochagus can produce many toxic factors, and five toxins are known:\\n1. Hundreds of cough toxin (PT): A protein in the Wall of the Bacillus cell wall, in the past, called leukocytosis or lymphocyte promoter, LPE, histamine sensing factor, HSF ), Insulin secretion Protein (IAP), and hundred-day coughing toxin consists of five non-current co-chain subunits (S1 ~ S5), subunits (S2 ~ S5) are non-toxic units, energy to host cell membrane In combination, by medoxifying the toxicity by the sub-unit S1 having enzyme activity, S1 can vary by adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-riboside transferase, catalytic partial ADP-ribothermia from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) Separate, transfer to the cell membrane inhibit the binding of glycine triphosphate (CTP), which can cause cell changes, while also promoting lymphocytes increase, activates tyrants and enhances immune responses.\\n2, heat-resistant endotoxin (ET), 100 ° C 60min can only partially destroy, 180 ° C can be inactivated, this toxin can cause the body to heat and cock.\\n3, non-heat-resistant toxin (HLT) This toxin heating 55 ° C can damage its toxicity, this toxin antibody has no protective effect on 100-day Ethiocardium infection.\\n4, tracheal cytotoxin (TCT): can damage host respiratory fiberioplasmic cells, calendering, necrosis.\\n5, adenosyl cycloacteria toxin (ACT): An enzyme in the surface of the cytoplastine cells, this enzyme is activated by calcium concentration, catalyzes CAMP, and inhibits neutrophils. Chemotization and phagocytic cells to sterilize it, allowing it to sustain infection, ACT is also a hemolynee, can have a hemolytic effect, and the important antigen of a temperate cough is two blood coagulant antigen, a filamentous blood. (FiLamentous Hemagglutininininin, FHA), is determined in the process of a cyclopellasia in the process of cyclopellasia in the process of a cytoplasty, which is a pathogenic. Experiments have found that FHA immunization mice can fight against 100-day Etougiobacillus lethal attacks, so FHA is a protective antigen, another aggluginoS, AGG is a protein component in the 100-day metoplastoma and bacteria hair, mainly 1 2, 3 serotypes, AGG-1 has specifically; the AGG-2, 3 has type specificity, by detecting the type of agglomerates to understand the local popularity, currently considers these two hemagglutints Antigen corresponding antibody is a protective antibody, and the 100-day Ethiocardium is divided into seven-type aggregation according to the non-heat-resistant aggregate antigen, and the 1 type aggregation is originally equipped with all the hundred-day Cysisfacials, and the 7-type agglomeration is originally Bobia (including the second hundred days cough Bacillus, bronchial seporatomy, 2 to 6 types are divided into different serotypes at different cooperation, and the serotype is mainly studying the serotype of the epidemic strain and selects special serotype strains. , Sub-rigorous colostrum and hundred-day Ethiocardium have no cross immunization, can also cause epidemics, 100-day Ethioplastoni resistance to external physical and chemical factors, 55 ° C is damaged, and it can be killed in the drying agent, and the ultraviolet line The resistance is weak, but there is a longer living in 0 ~ 10 ° C.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\n1. The pathogenesis: the pathogenesis of the trees is not very clear, it is very likely to be a result of the comprehensive role of the hydrazine of the body. When the bacteria immersed in the breath of the susceptible person, the bacteria filamentous hemagglin is adhered to the throat. Bronchial mucosa fibropolitic epithelial cell surface; follow, bacteria in partial reproduction and produce a variety of toxins such as peroperative toxins, adenosine cycloacteria, etc. And the whole body reaction, due to the lesion of the epithelial cells and the sputum and necrotic epithelial piles in small bronchi, the secretions are discharged, and the peripheral nerve of the respiratory tract is incorporated into the cerebral cortex and the medullary cough center, reflectivity Spasmity cough, due to long-term stimulation, the cough center has been excited, so that non-specific stimulation, such as eating, pharyngeal examination, cold wind, smoke, injection pain, etc., can cause reflective cocking, and the recovery period can also cry and cry and Other infections, induced cytopathic cough, recent studies have shown that there is a cytoplasma-based immune function that is damaged by the Host cellular immune function of the 100-day vitamin toxin substance, CD4 + T cells and Th1 cells secreted with cytokines, in a 100-day Ethiocardium infection It plays an important role in it.\\n2, the disease is understood: 100th Cithia invades nasopharynx, laryngeal, bronchial mucosa, visible mucosa congestion, the base of epithelial cells has multi-core white cells, monocytes infiltration and partial cell necrosis. In addition to inflammation infiltration in bronchial and alveolar, it can be seen that epithelial cytoplasmic aerosol formation, and even nuclear membrane is broken, necrosis, fall off, but very little wavefront. If the branch obstruction can cause a lung, the bronchial expansion, the secondary infection, is prone to bronchial pneumonia, sometimes there is interstitial pneumonia; if there is a hundred-day cough, mirror inspection or naked eye can be seen in brain tissue congestion edema, point-shaped bleeding , Cortical atrophy, neurocyte denaturation, cerebral edema, etc., which can often be seen in the liver fat infiltration.',\n",

       " 'Because of a variety of viruses and bacterial infections, the more common syncytial viruses, subflu virals, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, nasal viruses, and pneumoniae areas, most cases can be infected with bacterial infection on the viral infection.\\nThe trachea and bronchial of infants and young children are relatively small, and their surrounding elastic fibers are perfect, so their mucosa is susceptible to infection or other stimuli and swelling congestion, causing pipeline stenosis, and secretions are viscous and difficult to cough, thereby producing breath.\\nBecause infants and young children have many viral infections, only a small part of the child is breathed bronchitis performance, suggesting that the same virus has different pathological changes and clinical performance generated by different individuals, and is closely related to the internal factors of the body.As in recent years, the syphilosis caused by the astoni-like bronchitis caused a specific IgE antibody, and the tissue amine concentration in the nasopharyngeal secretion is significantly higher than that of the same infection without wheezing, and its relatives often have allergic rhinitis.History of metamorphic reactive diseases such as urticaria, asthma.About 30% of the children have suffered eczema, and the blood SiGe content is often increased.',\n",
       " \"Any factor leads to an intrauterine or marital hypoxia in the fetus. Since hypoxiamia stimulates the fetal breathing center, there is a breathing of breathing, but the amniotic fluid is sucked into the respiratory tract, and the amniotic fluid is absorbed by alveolar capillaries, and the sebum of amniotic fluid and falling angle of epithelial cells can cause chemical in alveolar. And mechanical stimulation, diffuse pneumonia, and decrease the gas dispersion function.\\nAbnormal Labor is also called DYSTOCIA. Its main feature is slow and extended. Factors that cause abnormal childbirth include production force, birth, fetal and maternal psychological factors. The labor extension will increase the child's complications during childbirth, and severe people can directly endanger the life of the mother.\\nThe fetal palace is due to the occurrence of fetal hypoxia, and most of the majority occurs after the premium, but can also occur in pregnancy. The fetal palace distress is a common cause of the death period of the fetal perinatal and neonatal nervous system, accounting for the first place for death. It can be divided into acute fetus distress and chronic fetal distress.\\nThe fetus body weight ≥ 4000g is called a huge fetus.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive cocci, a capsule, which causes pathogenic force to an invasion of the tissue of polymer polysaccharides. A small number is pneumpermacillus, golden Staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococcus, flu monemophili, and the like.\\nWhen the body is cold, excessive fatigue, drunkenness, cold, diabetes, immune function, etc., so that the respiratory defense function is weakened, bacterial invades the alveolar through the metamorphosis, enhances the permeability of the alveolar wall capillary, slurry and cellulose exudate, rich Bacteria in the oozing of proteins rapidly reproduced, and spread to neighboring lungs adjacent to the neighboring pulmonary tissue through alveolar blesses or breathing fine bronchi. The spread of the spread of the large leaf is caused by the dispersion of the virgin discharge.\\nBig leaf pneumonia lesions start in partial alveolar and spread to a lung segment or whole leaf.

SCLERODERMA, is a native tissue characterized by limiting or diffuse skin and internal organs, which is characterized by connective tissue of fibrosis, hardening and atrophy. It is characterized by fibrosis of skin, synovial membrane, skeletal muscle, blood vessels and esophagus. Or hardened.\\nInhalation Cocaine Perez, 1 case of long-term smoking patients occurred after 3 weeks of suction cocaine, a pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome occurred. Contact gasoline vapor hydroxyides, Turboot oils and inhale various hydrocarbons.\\nPathogenesis\\nSince some cases cause the body to generate an anti-pulley, the glomerular base film antibody is generated, and thereby attacks glomerulos and lungs, a type II metamorphosis reaction occurs, as for the simultaneous immune complex to the alveolar and glomerulane. There is no exact explanation of the pathogenesis of complement (III-type metamorphosis).\\n1962 Steblay et al. Confirmed that the lung bleeding-nephritis syndrome of the glomerular base membrane (GBM) damage was mediated by anti-GBM antibody, and a large number of research work after subsection focused on separation and studying the GBM component, looking for antibodies The corresponding antigen and the molecular structure and characteristics of the antigen, in recent years, with the rapid development of molecular biology and biochemistry, in the α3 (IV) chain of newly discovered collagen IV, NC1 domains of the α3 (IV) chain It is a GoodPasture autogen, also known as the GoodPasture antigen, which cloned the antigen gene CO14A3, positioned in the second chromosome Q35 to 37 region.\\nIt is confirmed that indirect immunofluorescence and immuno electron microscopy techniques are confirmed that GoodPasture antigen is not only seen in GBM, but also distributed in a renal tubular film (TBM), alveolar capillary film (ABM) and other tissue base films (such as choroid, corneal, crystal, retinal vessel) Base film, etc.), but the goodPasture antigen having a pathogenic action is mainly distributed in the reversibility of GBM, TBM, and ABM, antigen, which can expose the reversibility of its exposure process. In vitro, the α3nc1 structure can be exposed by 6 mol hydrochloride or pH 3. Domain, but in vivo antigen is exposed and produced immune response injury GBM has not been fully understood. It is now speculated that the GoodPasture antigen hide in the collagen IVα3nc1 domain under physiological conditions, various induced factors (toxins, viral infections, bacterial infections, tumors, Immunoma-genetic factors) and endotoxs can activate epithelium, endothelium and membrane cell proliferation, and release inflammatory media (IL-1, RDS, prostaglandin, neutral protease, etc.), GBM, etc. under cell enzyme, collagen IV Advanced Structure Decoction, Exposure of the GoodPasture antigen determinant, stimulating the body to produce antibody, resulting in immunization damage, due to the endothelial layer of the glomerular capillaries in the whole body capillary capillary, so that the antibody can be directly directly to the GBM antigen In contact, the ABM only dismisses its integrity when it is affected by certain external factors such as infection, smoking, suction gasoline or organic solvents, the undervisor antigen has a disorder, which is the most kidney Easy to be tired and the degree of accumulation is consistent with antibody titers, while the degree of lung accumulation is inconsistent with antibody titer.\\nHLA-DR2 and other anti-primary frequencies such as HLA-DR2 in this disease (only 39%, normal control only 32%), and the length polymorphism analysis of gene DNA restriction fragment was also shown in this disease and HLA-DR4, HLA-DQβ chain gene DQWLB and DQW3 is related to indicating that HLA secondary antigen related lymphocytes have a certain role in this disease. It has been experimentally found that if only the active animal anti-GBM antibody can produce GBM line shape, but does not occur, only simultaneous input After T cells were ill, thus confirmed that T cells played an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In recent years, research has also found that certain cytokines such as tumor necrosis factors, IL-1 can aggravate the development of this disease.\\nThe pulmonary lesion is characterized by large blood spots, there are more blood spots in the surface, and there is a large amount of red blood cells under the geolar cavity, and many macrophage containing iron-containing macrophane, the alveolar wall is concentrated, fibrosis Alveolar cells are hypertrophic, and the electron microscope can be seen, and there is electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with normally, and the endothelial cells are normal, and the immunofluorescence examination shows that the capillary wall is IgG, C3 is continuous or discontinuous Deposition.\\nKidney lesions can be seen in the double kidney soft and white, there are many small blood spots on the surface, and most of the variants of glossy nephritis is generally non-heavy, but the endothelium and measuring cell proliferation is generally not heavy, and the capillary cellulose sample is broken. Advanced glomerular fibrosis, kidney mass visible inflammatory cell infiltration and interstitial hemataritis, renal tubular degeneration, shrinking and necrosis, electron microscopy can be seen under the balloon under skin cell proliferation, forming a crescent body, a measuring matrix hyperplasia, substrate Membrane fracture, glomerular capillary walls generally do not have caused primary sediments, and there is an electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electronically. IgG (100%), C3 (60% ~ 70%) along the glomerulus The capillary wall is linearly deposited, and the antibody IgG positive in the distal tubular base membrane is in some patients.\\nIt is contemplated that the present epigenetic is mainly derived from the base film (GBM) antibody, and the immunofluorescence inspection indicates that IgG is deposited along the glomerular base membrane. The syndrome is diagnosed as pulmonary hemorrhage-nephritis syndrome, another patient Clinically, like pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome, but immunofluorescence shows that IgG is granular deposition along GMB, anti-GBM antibody is negative, and actually this part of the case is immunogenic nephritis (ICGN), autoimmune mechanism is in this disease The important role is that the ICGN is due to the corresponding part of the immune complex is deposited in the corresponding parts of glomeruli and alveolar.

Cell viability, animal experiments demonstrate that there is a significant decrease in dynamic fluid after macrophage phagocytosis, and the visual particles in the macrophage in the macrophage in the liquid can reduce normal cell viability. After the treatment of vaporial alveolar lavage, its alveolar macrophage viability It can be increased, and the study did not find that II cell generated protein increased, and the whole body lipid metabolism has no abnormalities, so it is generally considered that the disease is related to the decline in clearing capacity.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\n1. The pathogenesis of alveolar protein is not fully clear, there are several assumptions:\\n(1) Surface active substance clearance is discovered that alveolar protein sediments and all lung lavagers are very similar to those of the alveolar surface active substance secreted by Type II pulp epithelial cells, suggesting alveolar protein deposition. The object may be related to the alveolar surface active material metabolism, most evidence that alveolar deposits may be caused by excessive alveolar surface active substances, rather than producing excessive, normal case of alveolar surface active substances (SP) With the removal of a complex dynamic process, alveolar type II epithelial cells are not only synthesized and secreted alveolar surface active substances, but also to alveolar macrophages involved in the removal of alveolar surface active materials, when certain factors such as infections, drugs, etc. The function of alveolaens II cells changes, resulting in a decrease in the removal ability of the active substance of the alveolar surface, which initiates deposition of surface active substances in the alveolar, and recent studies have also found that surfactant protein A (SP-a) is not only Adjusting the secretion of the surface active substance and also adjusts the re-intake of alveolar type II epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages to alveolar surface active substances, and its role in PAP pathogenesis is still unclear.\\n(2) Evolux macrophage functional defects: many scholars have found that alveolar macrophages in patients with alveolar protein are low, phagocytic function, and phagocytic activity decline, Gonzalez, etc. When macrophages are cultured with alveolar lavage fluids in patients with alveolar protein, normal human alveoli macrophages will lose phagocytic ability, suggest that alveolar macrophages have inhibited alveolar macrophages in alveolar lavage fluids in patients with alveolar protein. Factors, the latest studies have shown that alveolar macrophage functional defects may be insufficiently related to granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or associated with GM-CSF / IL-3 / IL-5 receptor beta chain defects.\\n(3) Secondary in other diseases: Clinically some diseases, especially blood system, especially blood system, may occur, such as myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, Fanconi anemia, IgG type immunoglobulin disease, etc., although literature reports blood system malignant The average incidence of secondary alveolar protein in tumors was about 5.3%, but the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia was as high as 10%, different from primary alveolar protein, and secondary alveolar protein The lesions of the disease tend to be a focal type, and the symptoms are slight, and it is usually not required to be treated with alveolar inveolar.\\n(4) Abnormal injury of inhalation: Literature reported alveolar protein inhalation may be inhaled with certain physicochemical factors and mineral dust, such as white sinister, phenylbutanate, silicone and aluminum dust, etc. These can also cause alveolar protein stains that alveoliocritis may be related to certain physicochemical factors and mineral dust, but there is no direct evidence in humans and epidemiological studies indicate that alveolar protein deposition is related to the above substances.\\n(5) Gene mutation: The alveolar surface active material-related protein B (SP-B) gene mutation has been confirmed to be related to congenital alveolar, CPAP, has confirmed that the SP-B gene has at least 2 mutation sites. One is that the 121-bit base C is replaced by 3 base GAA, and the other is the lack of one base T at the 122-bit point, and the two gene mutations can cause SP-B deletion in the active substance of the alveolar. However, the clinical manifestation of congenital alveolar protein deposition is very large, and there may be other sites or new SP gene mutations.\\n(6) GM-CSF and its receptor abnormalities: 1994 Dranoff et al. Found that mice alveolar substance deposited in mouse mouse mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and there were many scholars. Studies have proven that patients with alveoliocytosis have the disorders of cytokine regulation balance, namely IL-10 expression and reduced GM-CSF expression and GM-CSF / IL-3 / IL-5 receptor beta chains. condition.\\nIn summary, the pathogenesis of alveolar protein is still not fully understood that any of the above causes cannot completely explain all cases, and it is necessary to further study in the future.\\n2.

The study of emphysema has proved that the concentration of the elastic polypeptide increases in patients with emphysema, and smoking can increase elastin solubility, inhibit the infiltration of fibroblasts of the pulmonary cells, resulting in increased tissue sensitivity to elastinase, inhibiting resistance The activity of elastase, these findings support smoking to break the balance of elastase and anti-elastases, resulting in damage to the fine structure of the lung, causing emphysema.\\nPathogenesis\\n1 Swell (often in the lung tip), all-leaf-type pulmonary emphysema (often in the bottom of the pulmonary base) and the distal leaflet type pulmonary immersion, all-small and leafy-type emphysema is related to smoking, these two types Emmonium is often combined and is evenly distributed in the upper leaf or lower leaf of the lung. When the emphysema is severe, the tracheal obstruction also has the development, and the inflammation of the anti-fracture trachee is caused by tracheal obstruction, and the tube is damaged. Mechanical support is lost, so that it collaps and tracheal obstruction, thereby causing increased intracellular gas to form a gas chamber.\\n2, emphysema, physiology: respiratory muscles have obvious changes in emphysema patients, other respiratory auxiliary muscles, the intercostal muscles can also work on normal length-tension curves, and the degree of rumor of the diaphragm is reduced, so that In the case of shrinkage, there is no sufficient chest negative pressure. When the diaphragm is met, it pulls down the lower thoracic, extruded the lungs, and the effect of the breathing, and the thoracol is caused to cause suction when the diaphragm is contracted. The function is converted into exhalation, the damage of the pulmonary wall structure reduces the pulmonary blood tube bed, the damage of pulmonary microcirculation has increased lung vascular resistance, and the lung blood resistance of pulmonary blood flow is reversed in the lung CO diffusion capacity.

       " \"Thrombus formation of pulmonary embolism is often a merger of venous thrombosis. The plug is typically derived from the deep veins of the lower extremities and pelvic, causing embolifiers by circulating to pulmonary artery; but rarely derived from upper limbs, heads and neck veins. Blood flow sludge, increased blood coagulation and venous endothelial damage are the promotion factors of thrombosis. Therefore, trauma, long-term bed, varicose veins, venous cannula, pelvic and hip surgery, obesity, diabetes, contraceptive or other reason, etc., it is easy to induce venous thrombosis. Early thrombus slabs, plus the role of the fibrilic system, so the risk of pulmonary embolism is the highest in the initial number of thrombosis.\\nHeart disease is the most common cause of my country's pulmonary embolism, accounting for 40%. A few times and a variety of heart disease, combined atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and acute bacterial endometric inflammation. Up to the right heart thrombosis, a few are also derived from the vein system. Bacterial ketchings are in addition to subacute bacterial endocarditis, can also be caused by pacemaker infection. The former infectious plug mainly comes from three-pointed valve, and occasionally, the two-pointed biological canopy can be reached into the pulmonary artery from the left heart defect.\\nThe tumor is the second reason for my country, accounting for 35%, far from 6% abroad.

When the thrombus is mechanized, the surface of the heart is gradually covered with the surface of the heart, and it is firmly attached to the arterial wall after 2 to 3 weeks, and blood vessel reconstruction. Early plug retraction, blood flow retransmate, covering cellulose, platelet trays and thrombolytic processes on the surface of the plug, can produce new plugs to further embolize small blood vessel branches. Whether the plug causing pulmonary infarction, the capacity of the blood flow, the blocked range, and the bronchial artery supply, and whether the ventilation region is properly determined.\\nThe histological characteristics of the pulmonary infarction are the blood bleeding and alveolar walls in alveolar, but rarely find inflammation. There is a minority when there is no pulmonary infection or plug in non-infectivity. The loss of active substances in the lung surface of the infarction area can lead to the loss of the lung, and the pleural surface is common, 1/3 is blood. If you can survive, the infarct area finally forms a scar.\\nAfter pulmonary embolism, the physiological dead cavity is increased, and the ventilation efficiency is lowered, but since the acute pulmonary embolism can stimulate ventilation, increase the breathing frequency and the amount of ventilation per minute, usually offset the increase in the physiological dead chamber, and maintain PACO2 does not rise even decrease.\\nExcessive ventilation and hypoxiamia are not related to hypoxiamia, and it cannot be eliminated by oxygen; the mechanism is not clear, and it is speculated that the reflection of the lung substance in the vascular embolization region is speculated. Although PACO2 is usually reduced, neuromuscular disease, severe pain and pulmonary embolism are severely increased, and CO2 retention can occur when the ventilation compensation is increased.\\nAcute pulmonary embolism, PAO2 is often lowered, and the ventilation / blood flow ratio disorder may be its main mechanism, local bronchial contraction, lungs and pulmonary edema are the foundation of its anatomical basis.

It has important viral biological significance:\\n(1) Neucine enzyme damage to the sialic acid contained in the host cell surface receptor can cause the flu virus to be released from the infected cells, and release the influenza virus that releases the extracellular fluvosis to disperse each other, There is always conducive to its spread.\\n(2) The respiratory mucus is also contained in the sacral acid ingredient, the gangluozyme has a cleavage activity, so that the flu virus breaks through the block of mucus, which is easy to spread in the respiratory mucosa.\\nDue to the important role of neuraminase in the influenza virus replication, and the active site of the neuraminase is highly conserved in the A, B influenza virus, therefore, many new anti-influenza drugs in development Na as a target of the pharmaceutical effect.\\n3, nuclear housing protein (RNP): a viral structure protein that cohesively constitutes a nuclear shell with viral RNA, including nuclear protein (NP) and three polymerase proteins (Pb-1, Pb-2, Pa), three polymerizations. The enzyme protein is synthesized in the host cytoplasmic, and then transferred to the nucleus, in the nucleus, the PB-1 is the highest homology, which is responsible for virus mRNA synthesis. After the extended extension, PB-2 is RNA polymerase depends on viral RNA, which functions to identify and bind to a cap structure transcribed by host cell polymerase II, can cut the cap structure from host cells and connected to viruses. On the 5th side of the specific mRNA, the cap structure is the primer of viral mRNA transcription, the transcription of the start RNA, during the transcriptional process, PB-2 may participate in the resection of mRNA 5 end cap structure, Pa in virus RNA The role in synthesis is not fully clarified, which may be a kinase or a hydrotreal protein.\\n4, membrane protein (mA) is one of the structural components of the influenza virus envelope, including M1, M2, M1 containing 252 amino acids, and is the most abundant polypeptide in the viral body, which has a form of influenza virus. One of the main dependences, M1 may play an important role in sub-viral assembly, while protecting the ribonuclein particles, M2 is a complete membrane protein, containing 97 amino acids, only in the epiral influenza virus, M2 is in a large amount of tetramer formation in the surface of the trained host cell, while the content is small in the virus body, its function is a proton channel action, and the pH value in the gol base cavity in the HA synthesis, and the viral uncap process The acidification of the internal vesicle inside.\\nPathogenesis\\nInfluenza viruses can infect all kinds of cells of the respiratory tract, and can be replicated in it, the main mechanism of the disease is caused by viral replication, and the influenza virus enters and planted in the respiratory epithelium, and is carried out. And peg into the respiratory epithelial cells, and replicate in the cells, lasting 4 to 6 h, new viral particles from the cell membrane, release, re-infect adjacent epithelial cells, short-term respiratory tract Epithelial cells, necrotic, falling off, and local inflammatory responses, while causing systemic poisoning reactions such as fever, pain and leukocyte decrease, virus replication cytoplasm is the main principle of influenza disease, and excess interferon in circulation may Related to systemic symptoms, but no pathological changes in diseasemia, the pathological changes of simple flu are mainly due to upper damage in the respiratory tract, tracheal accumulation, cilia epithelial cell degeneration, necrosis and falling, cytoplasmic visible incident, mucosal congestion edema Nuclear cell infiltration, but the basal cell layer has no damage. After 4 to 5 days of the disease, the base layer has begun to proliferate, forming undifferentiated epithelial cells, and the formation of cilia is recovered after 2 weeks, and the pathological characteristics of influenza viral pneumonia are in the lungs Extensive bleeding, lungs are dark red with edema, tracheal, bronchial bleeding, mucosal congestion, tracheal, bronchiosis, mucosal cell necrosis, mucosa under mucosa, edema and mild inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar fibrin Original oozing, neutrophils and monocytes.\",\n",

The minimum contact amount and individual susceptibility have mainly role in the etiology. It is more stable, beryllium mine smelting, manufacturing beryllium alloy, can be hinged and hinged. Tablet dust or soot, its compound has an oxygen, hydroxide, fluoride, chloride, etc., mainly in the form of a breathing tract in the form of smoke or dust.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nAcute beryllium poisoning is a high concentration of direct chemical toxicity stimuli of respiratory system, and is a poisoning of organism, which is characterized by respiratory inflammation and chemical pneumonia - based tissue morphology. Neritorial and necrosis of hepatocytes and necrosis of nephrosis and necrosis, acute beryllium poisoning has a dose reaction relationship.\\nAlthough the pathogenesis of the chronic beryllium poisoning is still not fully clear, most scholars believe that it is a delayed cellular immune disease, and the binding of inside is bonded to the in vivo, and induces a non-ferrous resistant antibody, once again When exposed to beryllium (even if the exposure concentration of exposure) causes a beryllium antigen-antibody reaction, an inflammatory lesion is generated as a systemic disease in which pulmonite fibrosis and granuloma are formed as a major lesion, and its incubation can be several months or numbers Ten years, the patient's serum increases, the skin spots test, leukocyte movement inhibitory test and the original lymphocyte transformation test often have positive, glucocorticoids have obvious treatment effects on chronic beryllium poisoning.

       " \"Cause\\nIt has not yet been fully understood, waiting to be studied, speculation is related to the following reasons:\\n1. Cerebrovascular flow regulation function reduces normal neonatal cerebrovascular blood flow to adjust blood flow into brain tissue, when blood flow is reduced, cerebrovascular is diastolic, and when blood flow increases, the cerebral blood vessel shrinks, with this function Keeping the flow of the brain tissue is relatively stable, the blood pressure fluctuation is large, the blood flow changes is more, but the adjustment function of the cerebrovascular blood is reduced, when the blood pressure decreases, the blood flow is reduced, the cerebral blood vessel is not possible in time Droupless, formation of low perfusion of the brain, increased blood pressure, increased blood flow, the cerebral blood vessels have not been contracted in time, transform into high perfusion, the most prone to cerebral edema and intracranial hemorrhage during this transition, and low perfusion itself Can be used to expand oxygenous encephalopathy.\\n2. The metabolism of abnormal human organs of brain tissue has the highest amount of oxygen and glucose in the brain, and the energy supply is inadequate during hypoxia ischemia. The metabolism affects brain tissue is also the largest.\\n1 oxygen self-esteem (O2-) is damaged by a peroxidation reaction in the cell membrane, and the permeability of the capillary wall cell is increased, resulting in cerebral edema;\\n2 Calcium ion channels on the cell membranes are open, and extracellular Ca ++ flows into the cell, destroying the survival of cells;\\n3 brain in brain tissue increase, directly inhibit breathing, increase hypoxia;\\n4 Metabolic and respiratory acid poisoning occurs when hypoxic ischemia, and the abnormal abnormalities of the above brain tissue can cause brain tissue to soften, necrotic, bleeding and forming a hole.\\n3, brain to susceptible area for hypoxia ischemia\\n1 Different germatitis has differently, the degree of susceptibility to hypoxia ischemia is also different, rich in cells, high vascular, high metabolic rate, high oxygen demivity, is the most sensitive to hypoxia ischemia, Premature infants' susceptible area under the ventricle pipe film, due to the most active cell metabolism at 28 ± weeks in the district, and the district capillaries lack support for connective tissue, easy to bleeding, to the premium 32-34 weeks The active cells of the post-born layer have gradually moved to the cerebral cortex, which is replaced by white matter, but because of the arterial endless area, the blood supply is insufficient, can still be affected by hypoxia ischemia, and the cerebral skin of the foot is active. The transfer of cells becomes a susceptible area;\\n2 The arterial end tip of the artery is due to the low blood pressure, the blood pressure is low, and has become a good part of hypoxia ischemia. The top of the foot of the foot is in front of the brain, middle and post-mobilized end of the end, the most prone to disease, premature infants The white matter zone around the ventricle also is a arterial ending area, which is prone to organizational softening.\\nPathological change\\nAfter the hypoxia ischemia, edema, softening, bleeding, and necrotic death, and then form a hollow, underneath, beads, and epidural, the ventricle may shrink.\\n1. The diseases of cerebral lesions are mostly in the cerebral cortex. In addition to edema, there is a bleeding and necrosis, forming a blast cavity, such as a spinene, said that a large cavity is called an empty brain (Porencephalen).\\n2, the hemorrhagic part of the skull bleeding is mostly under the ventricular pipeline, and the full month is mostly in the brain, and the other, such as the epidural bleeding (SDH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in foot Month and premature infants can happen.\\n3, brain dry lesions in the brain stem neurocal or white matter, the brain dry can also be contrast in the cerebral leather.\\nThe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is caused by the suffocation of the full month. The more stolen, the longer, the cerebral disease is serious, the incidence of sequelae is also higher, the disease can also occur in premature infants, showing the softening of white matter around the ventricle (Periventricular Leukomalacia, PVLM).\",\n",
       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nAccording to the original disease, spontaneous pneumothorax can be divided into two types of primary and secondary pneumothorax.\\nFactors induced pneumothorax, cough, bending waist, or upper arm, weightlifting exercise, try to solve the stool, etc. The pulmonary tissue crack causes a pneumothorax, uses artificial respirator, if the gas pressure is too high, there may be a pneumothorax. According to statistics, there are 50% to 60% of the cases to find obvious incentives, with 6% patients and even in bed.\\n1. Primary pneumothorax is also known as a special pneumothorax, which refers to the pneumothorax of the health of the lungs. It has failed to find the pneumothorax of the health of the obvious lesion. The literature reported that this pneumothorax is the first place in spontaneous pneumothorax.\\nThe cause of this disease and the pathological mechanism have not yet been clear. Most scholars believe that due to the crack of Bleb and pulmonary bulke (BULL), it is found according to the pathological histological examination of the pulmonary hazabopathological histopathological histopathological examination of idioptric plexus. In the case of a non-specific inflammatory scar under pleural, non-specific inflammation around the bronchi causes the elastic fibers and collagen fibers in the dirty pleural and pleural, which can reduce the elastic decrease in the adjacent alveolar wall, resulting in alveolar crackers. The pulmonary braceles were formed under pleuriscus, and non-specific inflammation of the tube itself plays a one-way live-action, thereby generating an epidalable germplasm to form a pulmonary hazab.\\nSome scholars believe that the congenital development of lung tissue is not all the causes of pulmonary packed, that is, due to the poor development of the elastic fiber, the elasticity is low, the alveolar wall expands forms a large bubble, and Marfan syndrome (a common dyed Sexual genetic connective tissue is a typical example.\\nIn the cause of this disease, some people put forward the \"new film theory\", side support disorder mechanism, atmospheric pollution, etc.\\n2. Secondary pneumothorax is based on other lung diseases, forming pulmonary bulks or direct damage to pleura, often chronic obstructive emphysema or inflammatory fibrosis (such as silicone, chronic tuberculosis, Based on diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, cystic pulmonary fibrosis, etc. When it increases in cough, sneezing or intracellular pressure increases, 179 patients with spontaneous pneumothoraxia, which have caused pneumothorax, Wu\\'s reports, chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary gemmoma account for the first place (38.5%). Secondly, the tuberculosis accounted for 17.3%, and the idioptic pneumothorax is 13.4% (3rd), golden staphylococcal pneumonia is 12.3% (4th), the rest is other reasons.\\nPulmonics caused by S. aureus, anaerobic or Gram Negotic bacilli, etc. Pneumothorax, bronchial pulmonary vesicle rupture, etc. can be passed and passed, in addition, the esophagus or the like is inserted into the pleural cavity, and it can also cause pneumothorax to use glucocorticoids for a long time.\\nAdvanced pneumothoraxes caused by certain diseases have been gradually noted by people in recent years:\\n1 lung cancer, especially metastatic lung cancer, with the progress of comprehensive treatment, the survival period of patients with lung cancer is gradually extended, and the pneumothoraxing of lung cancer is increasing; the incidence is 4% of lung cancer (especially in advanced small cells) Lung cancer), the cause is: tumor blocking fine branch trachea, leading to limitant air and swelling; obstructive pneumonia further develops into pulmonary hydrazines, and finally breaks to the chest; the tumor itself is infringed or destroying the dirty pleura,\\n2 nodular disease, mainly in the third stage, the incidence of pneumothorax is 2% to 4%, due to the post-fibrosis, resulting in the formation of pleuriscies or directly infringes the pleurum due to granulums.\\n3 tissue cells increased x: According to reports, its spontaneous pneumothorax can reach 20% to 43%, which has obvious pulmonary fibrosis in advanced diseases, and finally leads to \"honeycomb\" and forming pulmonary bulks.\\n4 Pulmonterioplasts (LAM): According to the literature, about 40% of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, Taylor reported 32 cases of LAM, 26 cases (81%) occurred in pneumothorax, this disease and estrogen change in vivo Closely relationship, due to partial or complete blocking muscle proliferation, causing pulmonary bulks, pulmonary vesicles, eventually resulting in a pneumothorax,\\n5 AIDS: The incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax is 2% ~ 5%, Coker and other reports of the pneumothorax incidence of pneumothorax in the AIDS, the mechanism may be: the pathogenic violation of pleural lung tissue, and is easy to pass card Lung sac pneumonia, the latter has destructive effect on lung and pleuro, resulting in pneumothorax; direct cytotoxic effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on pulmonary hypertrophy cause elastic protease release, leading to emphysema, forming pulmonary large Blister.\\n3. Special types of pneumothorax\\n(1) Menstrual pneumothorax: The anti-pneumothorax of the menstrual cycle is first reported by Maurer in 1958, and in 1972, it was officially named the menstrual pleasure of menstruation by Lillington in 1972. The incidence of only women\\'s spontaneous pneumothorax 0.9%, accounting for about 5.6% of female pneumothorax under the age of 50.\\nThe cause is mainly related to the endometriosis of lung, pleura or intra-intiminaosis, and the exact pathogenesis has not yet, but people have proposed some theories to explain the mechanism of the disease:\\n1 The endometriosis in the chest said that the reason is that the pneumothorax and the menstrual cycle are closely related; many cases have found endometrial ectopic in the chest; the right side of the disease and the endometriosis in the chest It is consistent; the age is also the same, due to the existence of endometriosis in the chest, and the endometrial lesion is congested during menstruation during menstruation, so that the lumen is partially blocked to form a \"live flap\" It causes excessive inflation of the distal limit to excessive thrust, but there is also a phenomenon that the endometriosis is not found to be about 75% of the endometriosis of the endometriosis due to this disease. Patients with endometriosis Frequent pleural effusion, menstrual hematopathizuck, but menstrual pneumothorax is not accompanied by hemoptysis and pleural effusion, so the menstrual pneumothorax caused by endometriosis only represents the cause of partial pneumothorax.\\n2 diaphragmatic channel crack hole: From the embryonic development and anatomy physiology of diaphragm, gas from the abdominal cavity into the chest is: congenital defects of diaphragmous muscles, such as Morgagni holes and Bochdalek holes, etc. Cavity venous hole; congenital rupture of diaphragm, such as diaphragmus and uterine endometrium, forming a cracked hole, MeiS \\'syndrome and tuberculous patients have confirmed that there is a path between the chest and abdomen, but there is no view in men. A spontaneous pneumothorant happened to a single cause of insaneness, and three spontaneous pneumothorax accompanying abdomen, and attempted to prove that there is traffic between the chest and abdomen by radioactivity imaging method, but the result is not supported. The information further confirmed that the female-specific pathogenesis, during the menstruation, due to uneven uterine contractions, the air may enhance the air into the uterine cavity, and then reached the abdominal cavity via the fallopian tube. At this time, the ectopic endometrial tissue of the closed diaphragmous muscles is detached. The diaphragmatic passage is temporarily open, and the gas is inhaled from the diaphragm cracked pore under the action of the chest negative pressure suction pump; instead of the mucusal plug, the cervix is \\u200b\\u200bblocked by the mucous plug, and the gas is entered into the chest, this theory can Explanation of many clinical signs of this disease, such as doing diagnostic artificial inerts can induce pneumothorax; as a tubal ligation or posterior pneumothorax can be cured after the uterus, however, there is a rare in the endometriosis and defect, only 19%, Many cases still have recurrence after surgery, and therefore there is still recurrence after surgery, so it cannot be a comprehensive and reasonable explanation of this theory.\\n3Kovarik, etc., it is considered that the intimae tissue in the pelvic cavity may vary from the diaphragm or blood flow, lymph route to form a lesion under the pulmonary enhancement, and fall off in the menstrual period, causing the pneumatic gas leakage to generate a pneumothorax, Japanese scholar reported 1 The diaphragmus was not seen before the chest exploration, and the endometrial tissue was found around the broken pulmonary bulfer, and this theory was supported.\\n4 Prostaglandin (mainly prostaglandin F2a) level increases with menstrual pneumothorax: prostaglandin can regulate the tulind function of pulmonary vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, Rossi believes that this disease is a patient\\'s prostaglandin F2a in the blood during menstruation. Rising, The bronchial smooth muscle contraction, the pressure of the airway increase, which causes alveolar and pleura rupture to form a pneumothorax, and the prostaglandin F2a can cause endometrial necrosis, but there is currently a lack of adequate evidence.\\n(2) Pregnancy-merged pneumothorax: Most of the fertility period, patients with this disease cause a pneumothorax for each pregnancy, depending on the time of pneumothorax, can be divided into early (3 to 5 months) and later (8 pregnancy) Both months, the mechanism is not very clear. Some people believe that the change in adrenal hormone levels and thoracotomy changes, the pneumothorax that occurs early in pregnancy, some scholars believe that the level of adrenal hormone is reduced (literature report patients) The 17-hydroxy sterol content in urine was 3.25 μmol / 24 h (1.18 mg / 24h), while the pregnancy was reduced to 2.77 mol / 24h (0.77 mg / 24h), but it also believed that the adrenal skin in the pregnancy, thereby inhibited Remediation after connective tissue injury, for spontaneous pneumothorax that occurred in the late pregnancy, may be related to the low compliance of thoracic cavity.\\n(3) Spontaneous pneumatic breasts: 60 years old, spontaneous pneumothorax is called the spontaneous pneumothorax of the elderly, in recent years, the incidence of this disease has increased, many men are more than women, mostly in chronic lungs The disease (about 90%), which occupy the first place in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the mechanism is not very clear, but may be based on the original chronic lung disease, due to the elderly systemic tissue and organs constantly aging, alveoli The flexibility is reduced, the whole body resistance is reduced, in general activities, even cough, sneezing and screen, and the stool can cause alveolar cracking to cause the pneumothorax.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nWith the development of science and technology, especially the further improvement and progress of optical technology and micro-camera systems and high-definition imaging systems, VATS (TV thoracoscopic technology) is widely used in clinical practice. The entire pulmonary surface lesions can be investigated, and the micro-pulmonary pleural lesions can be enlarged under high-definition endoscopy and television displays. Level 4: Level I is a special pneumothorax, endoscopic observation of lung tissue has no obvious abnormalities; II is a pneumothorax with a dirty layer, wall layer pleura adhesion; Class III is a dirty pleura bubble and diameter <2cm lung ; Ⅳ 号, there are multiple diameters> 2 cm of pulmonary bulks, this grading method has clinical practical value for guidance to choose reasonable treatment, such as the idioplastic chest, direct naked eye observation almost normal appearance, but appearing in new High-definition endoscopy and television displays enlarged observation of pulmonary blisters with 1 to 2 mm in diameter, can directly solidify the inner mirror laser or electric knife, or to induce pleural fixation, II still use laser Or directly solidified, or is closed with fibrin glue, but must decompose the adhesive belt during surgery, and the III can be directly solidified by pulmonary bulks in diameter <2 cm, but must be added with pleural fixation, grade IV. A giant pulmonary packer can withstand the opening of the chest surgery, and simple pulmonary bullenum extension or pulmonary wedrous removal can not be tolerated by the chest surgery, then sprayed into talc powder (or tetracyclines, etc.) Pleural fixation.\\nSome scholars have made chest surgery and histiplica examination based on pulmonary orblicular pneumothorax, divide the pulmonary sputum into three types: type I: is a thin-walled cyst, which is almost uncommon with the bronchi, basically belonging to the nature of lungs, single The cavity, there is no smascity in the cavity, the diameter is generally counts, sometimes up to 15 ~ 25cm, it is obvious to the ordinary X-ray chest radiograph, forming a tension large bubble emphy, and the surgery is used to remove the large bubble, the treatment effect is best. , Type II: The large bubble is medium diameter, fibrosis thick-walled, located in the deep lung quality, belongs to the lungs, the large bubble is separated by many intervals, and only the surface part of the leuki, one can be seen in the lungs II type pulse bulss, patients may have no symptoms, and X-ray chest phleti can also be free, but the spontaneous pneumothorax is caused by spontaneous pneumatic breasts, and the rupture of the bubble is generally peeping under the thoracoscope, III: is big Lung sputum, and not only exist in a pulmonary leaf, there is a plurality of beams in the bubble, and is widely used with bronchial transport. The type is the most common cause of diffuse propulsion emphysema. Once crack, the spontaneous pneumon is formed. The incidence and mortality rate are high.\\nIn 1980, OHATA and other reports, 334 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, a row of chest surgery, 126 cases of histological optical microscopy, and 60 cases of pulmonary gas and swelling bubbles were divided into three types on the basis of scanning electron microscopy: Reid type I, ReiDIT type and huge pulmonary pneumless, Reid type I feature is that the excessive expansion of lung tissue forms a large bubble, the neck stenosis is clear and the entire lung structure is clear; the pleura thin, the surface is skin The cells are sparse, some areas are even completely lacking, and the collagen fibers are exposed to the outside, and they can see the small holes or cracks of micrometers. The large bubble is flat, consisting of amorphous materials, scattered in a small circular Hole, while observing the small hole with a microscope during surgery, the electron microscope examination found that there is completely lack of mesothelial cells around the small holes, there is no cell substance in the inner surface of the large bubble, but the wave collagen fiber bundle, the ReidII is characterized by the pulmonary Bear is shallow; the neck is wider, and the dividing between the entire lung tissue is unclear, and the electron microscopy shows the relatively completeness of the pleural surface of the large bubble portion, and the short micro-velvet is still covered. Like the REID type I large bubble, deteriorated alveolar exposure to the cavity of the large bubble; the alveolar structure is relatively normal, and can be seen in the Cohn hole, the massive large bubble volume is large, occupying 1/3 of the single chest, large bubble The wall is thin and translucent, the electron microscope checks the surface of the large, and has a normal size of meteothelial cells and thick and short microroate and normal alveolar structures. Therefore, according to the pneumothorax pathology, it is further clarified that its pathogenesis is further clarified. The formation of spontaneous pneumothoraxes is not necessary to break with large bubbles, but may be due to pneumatic or complete lack of pleural mesothelial cells (such as REID Type I), the air is high in the lungs, air passes through the large bubble wall The cleft holes entered the pleural chamber, and it is important to play an important role in spontaneous pneumothorax occurrence.',\n",

In addition, T lymphocytes also have huge auxiliary effects on B lymphocytes, which is important to enhance immune complexes.\\nThe production of lung substantial inductive immune responses is important for the aggregation of inflammatory cells affecting lung tissue, selective adhesion molecules, adhesion molecular weighting and immunoglobulin plays an important role in the interaction of inflammatory cells and endothelial cells. Many cells are firmly adhered to adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and leukocyte antigens - 1 (LFA-1), TNF-α in induced ICAM-1 expression, and white blood cells outside the blood vessels LFA-1 and platelet endocyte adheres are expressed in white blood cells and endothelial cells, and urokinase type plasminogen activator (urokin U-PA) may be inflammatory cells from blood vessels to alveolar cavity.

And complement of the precipitate, most patient serum can find the precipitation antibody (IgG) of the corresponding antigen, which can develop the same pulmonary function as clinical exogenous allergic alveolitis, so this disease and complement The immune complex is of great significance to mediate the III-type metamorphosis reaction.\\n(2) T lymphocyte mediated IV metamorphosis reactions in recent years, IV-type metamorphosis reactions play an important role in the incidence of this disease, patients with probiotics in patients with cheese granuuloma, lymphocytes encounter corresponding antigen in vitro It can produce macrophage movement inhibitory factor (MIF), animal experiments found that the sensitization T lymphocyte is implanted into the experimental animal, and the antigen is inhaled, which causes lung injury to human exogenous allergic alveolar inflammation.

       " 'The fetus can produce PS in the gestational age of 22 to 24 weeks, but there is not much, and it is very small to transfer to the alveolar surface. As the premium of the gestational age, the synthesis of the PS is gradually increased, so the baby is more premature The less the amount of the PS, the higher the incidence of RDS, the more hormone in the pre-procurement of lung maturation, at this time, at this time, 32 to 34 weeks, after 32 to 34 weeks. The impact of the lung maturity is not very important. After 35 weeks, the PS is rapidly enters the surface of the alveolar surface. After birth, the lungs continue to develop, and the PS generated within 72-96 hours after birth is generally able to maintain normal breathing, so as long as it is PS lack stage is added, making premature bastions through difficulties, and survival can be improved.\\nThe blood sugar of diabetic pregnant women is high, and the blood sugar of the fetus also increases. At this time, the secretion of fetal insulin must be increased to adapt to the needs of sugar metabolism, so that glucose is converted into a glycogen. In this case, the fetus has a huge obesity, but The lungs are not necessarily mature, and the insulin has the effect of antagonizing the adrenal hormones, affecting the development of the lung.\\nThe embarrassment of the palace occurs in the fetus of the placenta. Due to the long-term hypoxia, the development of the fetal lung is low, and the PS secretion is low; and the suffocation is mostly caused by the cause of RDS in the newborns.\\nThe size of the lungs is normal. Since the height is full of blood, it is dark red, and the quality H is sinking underwater. The cut surface is widely absorbed in the dark red lung tissue Sumui red mirror, and the alveolar wall is close to each other. There is only a small amount of expanded alveolar in the lungs, and the wall attached to a layer of embossed is uniform and structurally, that is, a transparent film, sometimes visible to the transparent film is free in alveolar, the alveolar tube and the fine trachea are expanded, and the wall is also With a transparent film, the pulmonary tissue has edema, sometimes visible to the process of concentrating into a transparent film, and can be seen from the large single core and multicore cells, survive 32 hours, often concurrent pneumonia, and the transparent film has been absorbed Or is loose granular fragments.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe PS can reduce the surface tension of the alveolar wall and the alveolar gases, so that the alveolar is opened, and the half-life is short and needs to be constantly supplemented. When the PS is deficient, the tension of the alveolar surface increases, the alveolar plug, so that the energy loss, lungs The curve is moved down, the compliance decreases, the invalid cavity, the breathing work is significantly increased, the energy is exhausted, resulting in full body dirt failure, according to formulas:\\nP (alveolar retardation ratio) = 2T (surface tension) / R (alveolar radii).\\nThe minimum radius is the first to get the first pulmonary, so that the number of alveolarous alveolar and ventilation of immature pulmonary pulmonary, the alveolar is wide, and the gas dispersion and exchange are severe, the end of the alveolar drop Difficult ventilation, hypoxemia appears, the ability of alveolar epithelial cell synthesis of surface active material, resulting in clinical respiratory difficulties and hair control, continuous hypoxia, cause pulmonary vessel, low pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary blood flow reduction Lap-to-left distraction, pulmonary intravenous diversion, loss of ventilation-perfusion, affecting qi and blood exchange, continuous hypoxia and acidosis can cause myocardial damage, heart output, systemic low blood pressure, low perfusion, Finally, a multi-organ failure mainly based on respiratory failure is as follows: the active substance of alveolar surface is insufficient → the surface of the alveolar wall is increased (an increase in alveolar retransmission) → The minimum alveolar of the radius is the first to add → conductive lungs. → Oxygen, acidosis → pulmonary arteriosclerosis → pulmonary pressure increase → Oval hole and arterial catheter open → Right left shunt (continuous fetal circulation) → lung irrigation flow drop → lung tissue hypoxia heavier → capillary permeability Adding → fibrin sinking → transparent film formation → hypoxia, acidosis is more serious, causing a malignant cycle.\\nDue to the decrease in the secretion of the pulmonary PS, the blockage of the PS recirculating pathway, or due to excessive liquid in the pulmonary cavity (transport disorder, high oozing), a large amount of plasma protein is contained, and the pathological exudation fluid contains a large amount of plasma protein. In the alveolar cavity interference and inhibit PS function, the birth situation of inhalation, pneumonia, pulmonary development, pulmonary bleeding, pulmonary hemorrhage, and asphyxia hypoxia damage can be related to the above pathological physiology, premature influous pulmonary surface activity The total amount of phospholipids of the substance, only 10% to 30%, or less, and lack of the major pulmonary surfactant proteins such as SP-A, B, and C. It is the main reason for RDSN. It is used to apply exogenous pulmonary surface active material preparations. It can rapidly increase the content of lung surface in the lungs, and the lung surface active material is dropped into RDSN, and the lung surface activity is added to the lungs of RDSN.

       " 'The reasons for inhalation injury is mainly thermal, but at the same time, a large amount of smoke, carbon particles, stimulating chemicals, etc., etc., also damage the respiratory tract and alveoli. Therefore, inhalation injury is a mixed damage of thermal and chemicals.\\nInhalation damage is related to the injuries. It is often happening in an unopened or sealed environment, especially when exploding, in this environment, the environment is large, high temperature, not easy to spread, patients can not immediately leave the fire; plus in a closed space, combustion is incomplete, generated A large amount of carbon monoxide and other toxic gases, causing patients to poison and coma, and suffering from suffocation. When combining the explosion, high temperature, high pressure, high flow rate airflow and strong toxic gases can cause damage to the deep and lung substance of the respiratory tract. In addition, the patient stands or runs away, causing heat inhalation, and is one of the causes of injury.\\n1. Direct injury of heat on respiratory tract\\nThermally includes two kinds of dry heat and heat. Flames and hot air belong to dry heat, and thermal vapor belongs to wet heat. When the hot air is incorporated, the acoustic band is reflectively closed, and the heat transfer capacity of dry heat air is poor, the upper respiratory tract has a water heat exchange function, absorbs a large amount of heat to cool it; dry hot air reaches the branched branch At the time, the temperature can drop to the original 1/5 ~ 1/10. Therefore, dry heat tends to cause upper respiratory trays. Wet heat air is about 2000 times more heat capacity of dry hot air, and the conduction capacity is about 4,000 times the air is about 4000 times, and the heat is slow, so the wet heat is removed from the upper respiratory damage and the tracheal damage, and the bronchial and lung substance is also damaged.\\n2, harmful substances to respond to respiratory tract\\nIn addition to the granules inhalation of the smoke, there are a large amount of hazardous substances, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, peroxide, hydrochloric acid, cyanhydrate, aldehyde, ketone, and the like. These substances can cause direct damage to the respiratory tract by thermal action. Toxic gases can stimulate laryngeal and bronchospasm and have chemically damaged respiratory tract. Water-soluble substances such as ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, etc. are acid or alkali, which can cause chemical burn. Nitride can react with water, salt, and generate nitric acid and nitrite, directly corroded the respiratory tract, and the latter is bonded to hemoglobin, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Cyrr hydrogen can cause cytochrome oxidase to lose oxygen action and inhibit intracellular breathing. The aldehyde can reduce cilia activity, reduce alveolar macrophage viability, and damage the capillaries and cause the pulmonary edema. The acrolein content in the smoke produced by the polyurethane combustion is about 50 ppm, and chemical respiratory damage and pulmonary edema can occur in the suction of 5.5 ppm, and 10 ppm can cause death within a few minutes. The toxicity of cyanide and carbon monoxide is added, and when the temperature is increased to 1000 ° C, the polyurethane foam is decomposed to produce a large amount of hydrogen cyanide, and people can die when the cyanide concentration is 100 μmol / L during serum.\\nAfter the carbon monoxide in the smoke is inhaled, the carbon monoxide poisoning will lead to personnel, and the weight can die on the spot. When the air containing 5% carbon monoxide is suction, poisoning can be caused.\\nHis toxicity is:\\n(1) Carbon monoxide is combined with hemoglobin to form carbozemic protein, and the dissociation of carbon oxygen hemoglobin is equivalent to 1/3600 of the ionomoglobin dissociation rate, and carbon monoxide is more than 200 to 300 times the affinity of carbon monoxide and blood play protein. Therefore, blood band oxygen dysfunction is caused to cause systemic tissue hypoxia.\\n(2) Reduce the ability of cell enzyme systems to utilize oxygen. Carbon monoxide and oxygen competition cytochrome oxidase system, directly inhibits cell breathing.\\n(3) Carbon monoxide is bonded to myoglobin, reducing the delivery of oxygen in tissue.\\nIn addition, when the fire, high concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide can increase the symptoms of carbon monoxide, and aggravate tissue hypoxia.',\n",

Dust dispersion\\nThe degree of dispersion is a measure of the size of the dust particle, expressed in the percentage of various particle diameter sizes in dust. The bigger the proportion of small particles, the bigger the degree of dispersion. The dispersion size is closely related to the floating of dust particles in the air and its retaining portion in the respiratory tract.

In addition, individual factors such as age, health quality, personal hygiene habits, nutritional conditions, etc. are also important conditions affecting the pathogenesis of silicosis.\\nPathogenesis\\nAfter the free silica particles enter the alveolar, the pulmonary hypertrophy is concentrated in pulmonary lymph tank initiation site, and free silica has strong toxic effects on macrophages, which can cause self-dissolving death and dioxide. After the silicon is swallowed, it is wrapped in a phagocytic cytosoligate, and hydrogen bonds are formed between hydrogen atomic receptors (oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur atom) on the hydrogen atomic receptor (oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur atom) on the surface of the quartz surface and macrophages. Changes of changes in cell membranes and changes in permeability, resulting in macrophage lysosomas, and releases acid hydrolase into intracellular, which will cause macrophage death, and release quartz particles, form a vicious circle, resulting More cells are damaged, impaired macrophages release non-lipid \"solvent factors\", stimulating fibroblasts, resulting in collagen fiber proliferation, forming collagen-centric lesion nodules - nodules , The illegal joint is extended to the whole lung and integrates with each other, causing double lung diffuse damage. The fibrosis is not only limited to the lungs, but also in the lymph nodes migrated by macrophages, and serum γ in many silicosis patients The globulin level increases, the presence of autoantibodies, and γ-globulin in silicone disease, it is proposed that the immunological mechanism of silicosis occurs, but the immune ingredient does not appear to be involved in the formation of macrophages and fibrosis, so Secondary pathogenesis.\\nThe tandem joint is a characteristic lesion of silicosis. At the same time, it is accompanied by diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, and the silicon is often located around the bronchial and blood vessels, and the diameter is 0.3 to 1.5 mm. The general specimen sees the lungs, the lung is grayish, the texture is harder. The volume increases, the weight is increased, the surface is sandy or hard block, the cross section can be seen, the real world is clear, the texture is dense, and the lung tissue is visible in the nodule, usually all the pulmonary diffuse Distribution, local lymph nominals of the thoraculation and external lymph nominals, calcification or formation of 结.\\nThe microscope is shown in a circular or star malavine, and the center is composed of collagen fibers that have occurred in glass samples. The collagen fibers are arranged in concentric circles, and there are different ratios around methylene circles. There are different proportions around merger, macrophages, fibrous fibers. Cells and slurry cells are wrapped around, similar to hunque, gain, and then active, and polarized microscopy can identify the quartz particles deposited in the lung tissue with a polarized microscope.\\nThe lymph nodes of the lungs are the earliest part of the, and it can have the lymph node before the chest ends have not seen the illegal knot, and the general specimen shows that lymphatic soda is large, adhesion, histological performance is similar to the lungs, visible in lymph Dispersive non-nestal granuloma, as the disease progresses, similar fibrosis changes, lymph nodes can be changed from the change in lung tissue during typical silicon and severe interstitial fibrosis.',\n",

A cause can affect the body through different pathways, and multiple diseases can be used, and neonatal suffocation is Or the birth time factor, less postpartum factors, common causes are as follows:\\n(1) Pregnant hypoxic diseases: such as respiratory failure, congenital heart disease, severe anemia and CO poisoning.\\n(2) Diseases of placenta cycle barriers: such as congestive heart failure, pregnancy hypertension syndrome, chronic nephritis, blood loss, shock, diabetes and infectious diseases.\\n(3) Other: Pregnant amnesthesia, smoking, smoking or passive smoking, or pregnant mymest age ≥ 35 years old, <16 years old and multi-pregnancy, etc.\\n(1) Premature birth: premature infants, less than the fetal age, huge children, etc.\\n(2) Deformity: Various malformed nostrils, laryngeal, lung expansion, congenital heart disease and intrauterine infection caused by damage.\\n(3) Respiratory blocker: fetal suction causes respiratory obstruction or the like.\\nSuch as front placenta, placental early stripping and placenta functionality.\\nSuch as umbilical cords are pressed, too short, too long, neck or wind, prolapse, twist or knotted.\\nSuch as difficulty, high-level pliers, buttocks, fetal head attracting unsuccessful; in the production process, analgesics, analgesic and oxytocid use improper use.\\nPathogenesis\\nA series of pathophysiological changes occur due to various etiology caused by suffocation:\\n1. Cell damage after asphyxia, hypoxia can lead to cell metabolism and dysfunction and structural abnormalities, and even death, and are cell damage from reversible to irreversible evolution, and different cells have different susceptibility to hypoxia. The most sensitive Secondly, the myocardium, liver and adrenal cells, while fiber, epithelial and skeletal muscle cells have high tolerance to hypoxia.\\n(1) Reparalectable cell damage: The energy required for cells is mainly supplied by the ATP generated by mitochondrial, and hypoxia is first in the cellular oxygen metabolism, and the oxychirates in the mitochondria, so that the ATP is reduced or even stopped, due to the lack of energy, Oxygen, leading to cell metabolism, function and form abnormalities:\\n1 Glucose anoxic yeast enhancement: no oxygen detergent increases glucose and glycogen consumption, which is prone to hypoglycemia; it also increases lactic acid, causing metabolic acidosis.\\n2 cell edema: due to energy lack of energy, sodium pump proactive transfer disorder, so that sodium, water retention.\\n3 Calcium stream in intracellularity: due to the obstacle of the calcium pump, it is increased to the flow of calcium to the cells.\\n4 nuclear protein falling off: Due to the fallback of the nucleophyte from the crude endicular network, the synthesis of proteins and enzymes is reduced, and this stage can restore blood flow perfusion and oxygen, the above variation can be completely recovered, generally no sequelae.\\n(2) Inseparable cell injury: long or severe hypoxia will result in irreversible cell damage.\\n1 Severe mitochondrial morphology and function is abnormal: oxidized phosphorylation, ATP is disorder, and the mitochondrial production capacity is interrupted.\\n2 severe damage of cell membrane: loss of its barrier and transport function.\\n3 lysosomas rupture: due to dissolution membrane injury, lysosome enzyme diffuse into cytoplasm, digestion in the cellular components (self-satisfaction), even if blood flow perfusion and oxygen is restored, the above variation is not completely recovered. The survivors have left different degrees of sequelae.\\n(3) Hematic reperfusion injury: After recovery, blood flow reperfusion can result in increased cellular calcium overload and oxygen free radicals, thereby causing further damage of cells.\\n2. Ascending development process\\n(1) Primary apnea: When the fetus or neonatal hypoxemia occurs, high-carbonate and acidosis, due to increased catecholamine secretion, breathing and heart rate increase, the blood flow is re-distributed Selective vascular contraction, make the secondary tissue and organs such as blood flow such as lung, intestine, kidney, muscle, skin, and the main life organs such as brain, myocardium, myocardium, the blood flow increased, the blood pressure increase, increased heart output Such as hypoxemia and acidosis continue to present, breathing stop, called primary apnea.\\n(2) Secondary Apnea: If the cause is not released, hypoxemia persisted, lung, intestinal, kidney, muscle and skin flow is severely reduced, brain, myocardial and adrenal blood flow also reduces It can cause various organ functions and morphological damage, such as brain and myocardial injury, shock, shoulder ulcers, etc. Respiratory is suspended.\\nThe performance of the two apnea is no breathing and heart rate less than 100 times / min, so it is difficult to identify, in order to prevent rescue timing, there is no breathing person after the launch of the life should be suspended and processed.\\n3. Blood biochemical and metabolic changes after asphyxia, increased catecholamine and glucagon release, so that early blood sugar is normal or increased; when the oxygen is continuous, the sugar is increased, the glycogen is stored empty, hypoglycemia In addition to the increase of fatty acids, promoting calcium ions and proteins to cause hypocalocalocalocalocyhemia, and acidosis inhibits bilirubin and albumin, reducing the vitality of liver enzymes and causes high indirect gallbladder; due to left The secretion of the heart is increased, resulting in low sodama.',\n",
       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nThe main pathogens of this disease are \"mycoplasma pneumoniae) is a\" pleural pneumonia-like microorganism \"between bacteria and viruses. It is known for the smallest of pathogenic microorganisms that are known to independently. Cholesterol Special medium, after inoculation of 10 days, colonies, colonies are small, rarely more than 0.5mm, pathogen diameter is 125 ~ 150 nm, similar to the size of the mucus virus, there is no cell wall, so it is spherical, rod, filament, etc. A variety of forms, Gram-dyed negative, can only survive the ice, 37 ° C can only survive for hours.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nAfter the pneumoniae, the pneumonia is spread, after invading the respiratory mucosa, through its special structure, closely adsorbed on the receptor of the susceptible host cell membrane, which is proliferated and released toxic substance, such as hydrogen peroxide, enzyme, and membrane. Wait, resulting in tissue damage, its basic morbidity is a macrodynamic pneumonia and acute capillary bronchitis, and the microscope can be seen under a microscope, edema, beaten, cell membrane damage, epithelial cell cilia, missed, mononuclear cells and slurry cells Neutral granulocytes and necrotic epithelial cells can be seen in the fine branch tubes.',\n",

It is a mainly two-brown-brown-absorbing phospholipid, and the surface active material is discharged in alveolar. Inside, there is a function of reducing the surface tension of the alveolar-liquid cross-bound surface, there is a function of stabilizing alveolar preventing alveolar plug, if the surface active substance is lacking, the tension of the alveolar surface is increased, the alveolar retransmission force increases, the alveolar is gumped, resulting Many miniature lungs do not open (microatelectasis), the lack of active substances in the lung surface can be found in:\\n1 Premature infants are immature.\\n2 Bronchin pneumonia, especially viral pneumonia, is reduced in surface active substances.\\n3 wound, shock, etc., excessive ventilation, rapidly consumed surface active substance.\\n4 Inhalation of gas or pulmonary edema, such as surface active material damage, normal pulmonary surface tension is 6 dacco / cm, while the surface active substance is lacking, the surface tension of breathing evanhaust infants can reach 23 dacco / cm.\\n(2) Another non-blocking lungs may not be related to the neuromuscular structure of the pulmonary end airway: many scholars have confirmed, away from the airway until the alveolar tube and the pulmonary sac are muscles, and the smooth muscle and elastic fibers are interleaved. Together, it is controlled by plant nerve, when pain, like rib fracture and surgery, or bronchial is strongly stimulated such as bronchial angiography, muscle bomb fiber contraction can cause lungs, especially large lungs.\\n(3) The breathing is too shallow: after surgery and the application of morphine, or the coma and extremely weak patients can see the breath shallow measuring, when the lung pressure is reduced to insufficient to resist local surface tension, it can gradually cause alveolar closure and lungs. Zhang, encourage the patient's deep breath to prevent alveolar from closing, or reopen the alveolar closes due to the shallowness of the breath.\\nIn short, the lungs do not open the number of children in the child, and the disease is more common due to capillary bronchitis, bronchitis, asthma, bronchial lymphatic finisher, multiple nerveitis, bronchi foreign matter and surgery, in addition, it can be found in inhalation Pneumonia, bronchial expansion, intracranial hemorrhage, endocardial elastic fiber hyperplasia, congenital heart disease, tumor, etc.\",\n",
       " \"80% ~ 90% of the cold is caused by viruses, more than 200 viruses causing a cold; 10% to 20% of colds are caused by bacteria. Baby within 1 year old is more prone to colds because the immune system has not yet matured.\\nThe child's nasal stenosis, soft mucosa, insufficient mucosa secretion, dry dry, poorly adapted to the outside environment and resistance, and is prone to inflammation. Premature infants, children with congenital defects or diseases, such as cardiopulmonary functions, especially when they have innate immunogenesis, the care is slightly mistaken.\\nA result of 157 parents' nutritional knowledge and surveys, those who know general parenting knowledge account for only 10.2%. Since the child grows fast, children who take artificial feeding due to lack of breasts, and those who are too petty, eclipse, anorexia, malnutrition or imbalance, may cause different degrees of iron deficiency, calcium deficiency or vitamin and protein intake . Nutritional components such as iron, zinc, and protein have an important role in the synthesis of various globulins of the immune system and the promotion of immune cells. The body lacks vitamin A, resulting in reduced respiratory epithelial cells, disappears, glandular loss normal function, lysozyme and secretion of immune antibody significantly reduced, barrier function reduction, can cause infection. Insufficient calcium intake can cause pediatric disease, resulting in low resistance, virus, bacterial infection. Low calcium can lead to weakening the angioplasmic cells of the respiratory tract, so that the breathing tract secretion is not easy to discharge. These are the causes of the cold.\\nSome children's family room conditions are poor, dark and humid; some indoor temperatures are too low; some families like to turn off the doors and windows in the end of the day, air is not flowing; some family members are hobbied, plus the room with fire, smoke pollution severe. The environment is poor, air turbidity, very harmful to the respiratory tract, is an important reason for induces a cold. Some parents gave their children too much or too, the result is not sweating, it is cold, it is easy to induce a cold.\\nDue to objective conditions, it is not enough attention, many children lack outdoor activities. For example, in the northern and cold season, the child is in the room, and there are very few opportunities to act in outdoor activities. Some parents love their children, and children into the air-conditioned room. Once these children are cold, they cannot be adapted and have a cold.\",\n",
       " 'Asthma is a disease that occurs through environmental factors based on genetic susceptibility. Genetically susceptibility involves multiple genes and their interactions, and the environmental factors of pathogenicity are also varied.\\nGenetic this is the most important host factor. There is no known gene to exist in two or more studies, which means that the interaction between genes may be more important, and it is again confirmed the polymeric genetic characteristics of asthma. In addition, the target of the drug action, such as β2 receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, etc. also also research hotspots, but the abnormality of these genes may not only be related to the incidence, but also related to therapeutic effect.\\nObesity is an independent risk factor of asthma, especially for women. Obesity asthma patients are more difficult. Possible mechanism: 1, change the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. 2, adipose tissue release IL-6, TNF-α, eosinophil chemokine (eotaxin), leptin, and other inflammatory factors, so that the immune function is presented to promote inflammatory tendency. 3, obesity is also a centralized reflection of the body in genetically, developing, endocrine, and neuromed, these defects may also be the cause of asthma.\\n1. Inhalation allergens are the cause of asthma, this point of view is widely accepted. Dustocatophagoides sp.) Is the most common inhalation allergen induced by asthma. Pollen, dolphin, fungus spore-induced asthma often has seasonal characteristics. When you start a storm, you often raise a lot of pollen, which may cause many asthma patients simultaneously, called \"Thunderstorm Astma). Alternatively, the allergens in the environment can lead to chronic persistent symptoms in patients, such allergens come from home pet fraud, cockroaches, dust, etc.\\n2. The relationship between allergens and asthma is more complicated, may be affected by the type of allergens, the exposure dose, the exposure time, the age of the host, and the genetic characteristics of the host, sometimes, early contact allergy It can be induced by immune tolerance, but it has protective effects. In addition, it is strictly avoided that exposure to allergens fail to reduce the risk of asthma.\\n1. Interior and after birth contact with smoking smoke, increase the risk of asthma symptoms in children.\\n2. Smoking has a serious negative impact on asthma patients: which can lead to frequent accepted asthma, the lung function recession is accelerated, the condition is more serious, the inpatient rate increases, and the role of leather hormones is higher. Inflammatory response in the presence of neutral granulocytes in the airway of asthma patients in asthma, which is different from general asthma.\\n1, air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, ozone, can induce asthma attack.\\n2. The effect of air pollutants on the prevalence of asthma is still not determined. The city has been contaminated with a serious contaminated city and has not found the rise in asthma.',\n",
       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nThe incidence of asthma around the world is between 0.1% and 32%, which is close to 300 times, which may be related to genetic gene, age, geographic location, climate, environment, race, industrialization, urbanization, interior decoration, living standard, and diet. Habits, etc.\\nThe factors induce bronchial asthma are multifaceted, and common factors are as follows:\\nAllergic substances are roughly divided into three categories:\\n1 Causes infected pathogens and their toxins, pediatric asthma sects and respiratory infections are closely related, and more than 95% of infants and young children are due to respiratory tract infections, main pathogens are respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytic viruses (RSV), adenovirus , Influenza virus, subfluenza virus, etc. It has been shown that respiratory syncytial viral infection can cause wheezing due to a specific IgE-mediated type I metamorphosis, and other local infections such as sinusitis, tonsillitis, and dental caries may also be induced.\\n2 Inhalation: Usually inhalation of the respiratory tract, domestic skin test shows that the most important source of asthma is the most important source of dust, dust, mold, multivalent pollen (artemisia, dolphin), feathers, etc. There is also a report that contact silk throws asthma, especially the mites as inhalation allergen, and places a certain important position in respiratory metamorphosis reactive diseases. Childhood allergies are more than adults, spring and autumn is the most suitable season of survival. Therefore, dust mite asthma is good in spring and autumn, and the patient is more common. In addition, inhalation alterations, the asthma episodes are often related to the season, regional and living environments. Once they stop contact, symptoms can be reduced or disappeared.\\n3 food: mainly for allogeneic proteins, such as milk, eggs, fish shrimp, spices, etc. Food allergy is common in infancy, and gradually decreases after 4 ~ 5 years.\\nNon-specific stimulators (20%):\\nSuch as dust, smoke (including cigarettes and mosquito fragrance), odor (industrial irritating gas, cooking oil and oil odor, etc.) Cough and bronchospasm. Sometimes inhaling cold air can also induce bronchospasm. Some scholars believe that air pollution is increasingly serious, or one of the increasing causes of bronchial asthma.\\nChildren patients are very sensitive to climate change, such as the temperature suddenly getting cold or decreased by air pressure, often induced asthma attack. Therefore, in general, children in the spring and autumn have increased significantly.\\nIn asthma in children, the spiritual factors cause asthma attacks, but the asthma children are often affected, such as crying laughing or impulse, can cause asthma attack after fear. Some scholars have confirmed that they often accompany the vagus of vagueism when emotional excitement or other psychological activity.\\nAsthma has hereditary, family-friendly family and personal allergy history, such as asthma, baby eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, etc., is higher than that of general groups.\\nAbroad reports about 90% of asthmatic, often stimulating asthma, also known as Exercise Induced Astma, EIA, more common in large children. Dramatic continued (5-10 minutes), it is most likely to induce asthma after running.\\nAsthma caused by drugs is also more common. There are mainly two types of drugs, and one is aspirin and similar antipyretic impersonation, which can cause so-called endogenous asthma. As with sinusitis and nasal polyps, it is called Aspirin triasis, and other similar drugs have anti-inflammatory pain, methic acid. The mechanism of causing asthma may inhibit prostaglandin synthesis for Aspirin, resulting in a reduction in CAMP content, and release chemical media causes asthma. Such asthma is often reduced with age, and there is a decrease in adolescence after adolescence; another type of drug is a drug that acts on the heart, such as the heart, the degree of experience can block the beta receptor and cause asthma, and many spray inhalers can also be due to Stimulating throat reflectivity causes bronchospasm, such as sodium chromatarrate, easy purity, etc., other iodine production, sulfamine allergies often can also induce asthma.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nBronchial asthma is a multi-factor caused complex disease, and the pathogenesis is still unknown. The currently recognized mechanism has the following three aspects.\\n1, type I metamorphosis reaction and IgE synthesis regulatory disorder\\nAfter the antigen (alteration) first enters the human body, it acts on B lymphocytes to make it a slurry cell to produce IgE, IgE adsorbed on hypertrophy cells or basophils, and its Fc segment and cell membrane surface are binding The IgE is firmly adsorbed on the cell membrane, causing the body to be inactive, when the corresponding antigen enters the sensitizer, i.e., adsorbed on the combination of the Mermatic cell and the base granules, resulting in cell membrane deprotecting, release a series of chemicals Media includes histamine, slow reactive substances, combinity peptides, 5-hydroxyamine and prostaglandins, etc., these biologically active substances can cause biological effects such as capillary expansion, permeability, smooth muscle spasm and hyperthyroidism, and cause bronchial asthma.\\nIn recent years, many studies have shown that the increase in IgE is related to cellular immune dysfunction, and a large number of studies have shown that T cells are not only changed, and there may be functional defects, and the high IgE may also be related to inhibitory T cells.\\n2, airway inflammation changes\\nThe asthma model and asthma patients were biopsy via fibrous bronchoscopy and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL), which proved that the airway tissue showed different degrees of inflammatory changes.\\n3. Highly reactiveness of airway\\nThe high reaction of the airway is an abnormal reactivity of the airway to various specific or non-specific stimulation, and the asthma is highly reactive, the airway is high, and the Type I metamorphosis reaction), and continuous reactions. At present, the high response of sustained airway is mainly related to airway inflammation, and the mechanism of high-reacted high reactions in inflammation is mainly related to inflammatory mediators. The study found that the reactivity of the aperture of histamine and acetylcholine and the severity of children with asthma were parallel. These are related to nerve regulatory disorders, especially phytosis.\\nIt is known that bronchial smooth muscle is subject to sympathetic nerve and sub-integration nerve, and maintains dynamic balance under the regulation of brain-lower rock-pituitary. Normal human bronchial smooth muscle tension depends on the excitement of cholinergic receptors. The asthma is not the case, its deputy-intensive nerve tension increases, α-adrenergic neurological activity, β adrenergic nerve function is low or partially blocked. Because of these abnormalities, the hyperthyroidism of asthma is a pathophysiological basis of asthma episode.\\nThe main pathological changes of asthma are bronchial smooth muscle spasm, inflammatory cell infiltration, upper base film thickening and airway mucosal edema, epithelial fallfall mixed cellula, mucus secretion, mucosa membrane function disorder, thereby causing bronchial mucosa hypertrophy and bronchial Mucy plug. The results of the above pathological changes have caused the airway cavity, resulting in an increase in airway resistance and asthma.',\n",
       " \"(1) Causes of the disease\\n1. Primary - premature infants are simply caused by respiratory central development;\\n2, symptoms\\n(1) Hypoxia: asphyxia, pneumonia, pulmonary transparent membrane disease, congenital heart disease and anemia, etc .;\\n(2) Infection: sepsis, meningitis, etc .;\\n(3) Central nervous system disease: intraventricular hemorrhage and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy;\\n(4) The ambient temperature is too high or too low;\\n(5) Metabolic disorders: hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia, hypocaldermia, etc.;\\n(6) Stomach, esophageal return, necrotic coloreal colitis;\\n(7) Because of the excessive aberration of the neck, the breathing is suspended in premature infants, and the incidence rate can be as high as 50% ~ 60%, the smaller the pregnancy, the higher the incidence.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nMany clinical phenomena are related to neonatal apnea, some of which may be the cause of apnea, an important feature of various apnea is that when they happen to newborns, the episode of breathing is usually frequent and continuous. Newborn newborn often can find some cause, repeated breathing suspension of premature infants has no obvious lesions. Some people have proposed some mechanisms to explain the occurrence of newborns, in central nerve regulation, peripheral respiratory muscle movement, and Maintaining a smooth respiratory tract so that the gas exchange has a fine balance, and if this balance is broken, it can cause apnea.\\nThe immature of the development of the brain dry respiratory is the key to the respiratory suspension. When the hub and mixed apnea are suspended, the breathing hub is reduced to the output of each breathing muscle, and the breathing is from the sinus nodules. The electrophysiological activity of the spinal cord mesh activity system is very important for maintaining the impulse impulse of the nerve rhythm of breathing, from the upper (cortical activity) and the incoming impulse of the lower level (peripheral neurotactor, reflection arc). This neural connection can be excited or inhibitory, many neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory secretions such as endorphin, prostaglandin and adenosine can inhibit the activity of the respiratory central, but become age growth. Not that important, the output of the breathing center is the comprehensive and balance of the above influencing factors. In the newborns, there is a periodic change in weakness, and the respiratory suspension is the least in this cycle. It may also be the unstable performance of the respiratory regulation system, confirming the premature infants of the respiratory suspension of children with apnea, and its brain-drying time is prolonged, and this suggests that the ripe delay of the central, and supports This opinion: With the gradual maturity of the brain, the complexity of dendritic and synaptic contact increases, the stability of the central respiratory drive is improved.\\nBasic chemical drivers are relatively invalid for newborns, especially in premature infants, premature infants of the premature age of 33 weeks, their ventilation and respiratory muscles have lower sensitivity, and there is a respiratory suspension of premature infants, response curves for carbon dioxide Take a row curve indicating that the reaction of the ventilation increases is not large, but the sensitivity to carbon dioxide is increased with the age of birth and the birth of carbon dioxide, and the hypoxia is short-lived. Insufficient and sometimes respiratory suspension, in addition, hypoxia has reduced the reactivity of premature babies to carbon dioxide, which explains why breathing is suspended, and it does not be terminated quickly by hypoxia or high carbonate. This is also the cause of oxygen to improve critical hypoxemia, or transit red blood cells to treat anemia can reduce apnea.\\nThe excessive activity of the respiratory reflection in the neonatal period is also an important factor in respiratory suspension attacks. It has a large number of nerve tip receptors in the nasal wall, nasopharyngeal, or the throat, which can react to various chemical and mechanical stimulation. , Negative pressure attracts or inserts nasal feeding pipe to trioxual walls, often induce apnea and reflective tachycardia, secretions, liquids or stomach contents accumulate in the throat can induce apnea, with age and development The centralization of these highly reactive inhibitory capabilities is enhanced.\\nThoracic respiratory muscle (diaphragmus and coil muscle) and the upper respiratory tract (pharyngeal, throat) muscles open by maintaining airway can result in invalid ventilation, pharyngeal airway due to lack internal hard support, In the neck, the mandible is moved and the mandible is moved, and when the tongue is pressed, when the diaphragm shrinkage produces the negative pressure of the pharyngeal, exacerbated the shutdown of the airway, the collapsed airway wall hinders the airway due to the adhesion of the mucus Renewable, relieve the airway obstruction requirement airway to expand my muscle, such as the contraction or stretching of the airway, in the inhalation process, before the diaphragm contraction, the upper airway breathing muscle is superpolar, this pair of peak airflow When passing, the upper airway resistance is passed, it is important to promote ventilation. For high-caric acid stimulation, the upper airway breathing muscle is a curve reaction, and only a little increase in the initial increase, only in high carbon dioxide levels, the opposite, the diaphragmatic The reaction of high carbonic acid is shown as a proportion or approximate straight line, therefore, if the above airway respiratory muscle does not respond, the reaction is small or slow, and the reaction of the thoracic muscle is sensitive, which is the line up, this is not Coordination can lead to instability of the upper airway, a partial or complete airway blocking, which can induce a pneumatic infarction after the central respiratory suspension, and can explain why short breathing suspension, mostly central, and The longer breathing is mixed.\\nThe tractor of the thoracic and lungs put the thoracic expansion and the degree of lung inflation, passes through the distortion of the nerve to the center, and the strength and time of the breathing are adjusted, and the increase in lung capacity, strong pulmonary transition reflection (HERING-BREUER reflection) An action, that is, inhalation, extending exhalation; but increases this reflection with maturity, in contrast, the exhalation time is shortened to maintain lung capacity, and this increase is blocked The ability to duration of the inhalation movement is a compensatory mechanism to alleviate airway occlusion, and the adveneous fertile premature infants with breathing is significantly longer than the premature infants with breathing. It is suggested that the respiratory reflection is matched, the stronger the reaction ability of the blocking.\\nThe breathing of newborns is significantly subject to sleep, and in premature infants' fast-moving eye (REM) dynamic sleep dominance, and may be related to brain development, respiratory suspension is more often in REM sleep, at this time, the amount of tide and respiratory frequency at this time Obvious irregularities, in addition to strong central respiratory regulation inhibition in REM sleep, there are still inhibition of intercostal muscle movement, and when the intercostal muscles are not exercise, the diaphragm is contracted, and the result is a chest deformation (contradiction breathing), Resulting in invalid ventilation and reduces lung capacity, the diaphragmatic movement compensatory, can cause the diaphragm muscle fatigue and the upper airway, the thoracic deformation can also cause the intercostatic - inhibitory reflection, limit the impulse of the phrenic nerve, the final result is possible Respiratory is suspended.\\nIn short, neonates, especially premature infants, is prone to respiratory suspension is due to immature respiratory central development, easy to cause respiratory regulation disorders, newborns respiratory anatomical structural development is imperfect, physiological function is unstable, physiological information cannot be passed correctly, thus breathing rhythm The cyclical respiratory and apnea have a total of pathological physiological basis, and the apnea is further developed on the pathological basis of cyclical respiratory. The respiratory disorder is present in the respiratory center, the central chemical susceptor, the surrounding chemostat and the lung reflection, may be multiple Factors work, breathing suspended infant respiratory regulation center is in inhibitory state, such babies have small tide, low alveolar vent, PACO2 in alveolar, and have less pressure in the esophagus, and Paco2 is increased, and the ventilation reaction is poor, performance Respiratory central development is immature, and there is weak impulse, which is related to the poor function of the central nervous system.\\nNeonatal apnea can be caused by hypoxia, and hypoxia can inhibit the physiological function of neonatal respiratory central, and can reduce the reaction of newborns to CO2, and the baby's hypoxia is more severe, and the CO2 is more than adult. In contrast, except for other oxygen, such as body temperature changes, hypoglycemia, acid poisoning, etc., can inhibit the respiratory hub, causing apnea.\\nIn addition, the pile of respiratory secretions and the bronchial wall mucosa are swollen, and the resistance of the respiratory tract is increased, and even a certain degree of airway obstruction, it is necessary to increase the breathing function to compensate, the compensation ability of neonatal respiratory work is very poor, when the breathing load increases When it is not possible to effectively extend the inhalation time, change the esophagus pressure and increase effective elasticity, which is not perfect for this respiratory reflection. It is one of the reasons why the neonatal respiratory disease is suspended.\",\n",

       " \"(1) Causes of the disease\\nThe obstructive emphysema is extremely complicated, as follows:\\nSmoking\\nPaper smoke contains a variety of harmful components such as tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide. Smokers have increased mucous gyneancaps and neurine content, which can inhibit bronchial mucosa cilia activity, reflectivity causes bronchial spasm, and reduces the role of alveolarocytes. Smokers are also more than smokers in smokers and pulmonary vapor swollen or slow branches and deaths or pulmonary heart.\\n2. Atmospheric pollution\\nThe corpse material has proved that the rate of pulmonary swelling in the severe contaminated area is high than pollution.\\n3. Infection\\nRespiratory virus and bacterial infections have a certain relationship with emphysema. Repeated infection can cause bronchial mucosa congestion, edema, gland hyperplasia, hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, and stenosis of the pipe wall, causing airway obstruction. The increase in protease activity in the lung infection is also related to emphysema formation.\\n4. Protease-anti-protease balance disorder\\nSome protein hydrolase in the body have a digestive effect on lung tissue, and anti-protease is inhibitively effect on elastic proteases. The balance of proteases and antibolind enzymes is an important factor in maintaining the normal structure of the lung tissue from failure. The protease of digesion lung tissue has two sources, exogenous from bacterial and mold, etc., endogenous from neutrophil and alveolar macrophages. Smoking increases elastase activity and deactivates anti-protease.\\nα1 anti-suplasia is a glycoprotein synthesized from the liver to inhibit the activity of a variety of serine proteases. The α1 anti-supass is controlled by a pair of common-stained hidden genes, normal humans because of the M-type, ie PIMM. If it is replaces glutamic acid by lysine, it is Z-type. The PIZZ pureness in the population of foreign materials accounted for approximately 1/4000, and the PIMZ heterozygous was about 3% to 5%. PIZZ homogenic acid has severely reduced the activity of α1 anti - athabum in serum. It is easy to suffer from hepatitis and emphysema. The emphysema caused by α1 anti-supass deficiency is characterized by the following characteristics: the age of the disease is earlier, no smoking history; the disease is shorter, the gas is obvious; serum protein electrophoresis shows the decrease of α1 globulin, serum α1 anti-suplary activity decreases. The pathology is mostly full and leafy pulmonary emblem. Other types such as PIS and various heterogeneous PIMZ and PISZ are not increased. The α1 anti-supracidase deficiency is more common in Caucasian, my country is rare.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nChronic bronchitis symptoms\\nVarious factors caused by chronic bronchitis, such as infection, smoking, atmospheric pollution, long-term inhalation, and allergic factors, etc. The gas is easy to enter the alveolar, while the exhalation is increased in the pleural pressure, the bronchi is further closed, causing excessive gas in the alveolar and excessive inflation of the alveolar, chronic inflammation can also damage the small bronchial wall cartilage tissue, so that the broncho is lost normal stent And the bronchi is easy to trap, which hinders the gas discharge, causing too much gas in the alveolar, increased inveolar internal pressure, in addition, due to the increase of alveolar internal pressure, the capillary vessel of the pulmonary wall is compressed, lung Tissue blood supply reduction and nutritional disorder can also cause elastic decrease in alveolar wall, so chronic bronchitis is an important reason for causing obstructive emphysema.\\nThe mechanism of COPD airway inflammation is that when the body is stimulated by factors such as smoking, infection and environmental pollution, monocytes, macrophages and neutral granulocytes are rapidly synthesized and release cytokines, such as IL- 1, TNF- α, IFN, etc., these factors can induce vascular endothelial cell synthesis adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) increase, in addition, adhesion molecules (LFA- 1, VLA-4, MAC-1, etc.) surfaces are activated The expression is raised, and the corresponding adhesion molecules on endothelial cells are interacted, resulting in rapid adhesion of white blood cells, and transfers the endothelium to the inflammatory response, while the above-mentioned pathogenic factors such as smoking, infection, etc. The epithelial cells can also be stimulated, macrophages produce neutrophil chemokine IL-8, macrophages, protein-2 (MIP-2), activated and chemotaled neutral granulocytes gathered in the target position, thereby aggravating Inflammatory reactions, in addition, activated neutral granulocytes release protein decomposition and elastin enzyme can make the bronchogenesis, decrease in cilia, and mucus secrecy, resulting in mucus retention and bacterial reproduction, so that the inflammation is repeated and delayed.\\n2. Protease-anti-protease balance disorder\\nCertain protein hydrolase is currently considered to have damage to the pulmonary tissue, and the anti-protease is inhibited by a variety of proteases such as elastic proteases, protease and protease maintenance balance are important to ensure the normal structure of the lung tissue from damage Factors, such as lack of proteases or protease increases can cause emphysema in the disability of the lung tissue structure.\\n(1) Antibulin: Protease Inhibitor in the human body, wherein the α1-anti-suplary enzyme (α1-AT) is the most active, in addition, there is α2- Gullyolin (α2-M) and anti-white protease (Antileukoprotease, Alp), α1-AT are acute phase reactorin, synthesized from liver, 45 ~ 56 kD, normal serum concentration of 1360 ± 176 mg / L, infection The levels of serum α1-at-at levels can be raised in various inflammatory reactions, and the activity of a variety of serine proteases can be suppressed, and α2-m is also synthesized by hepatocytes, large molecular weight, and when the vascular permeability increases, the horizontal level in the lung tissue begins. Elevation, ALP synthesis and secretion are in the airway, with the performance of an inactivated elastinase, and therefore, α1-AT, α2-m and ALP synergies to protect the lungs and airways to make it not used by proteases. destroy.\\n(2) Protease: Destroying the protease of the lung tissue has two: an exogenous protease from the pathogenic bacteria; two dense proteases of neutrophils and macrophages, wherein human neutral elastases (HNE ) Is most important, and the emphysence is also the most closeness, HNE is a serine protease, and each neutral granulocyte contains about 3 mg, 106 granular cells can hydrolyze 0.4 mg of pulmonary elastin, α1-AT Combined with HNE into a composite that is not easy to dissociate, the elastic protease is inactivated, and the macrophane elastinase is a metalloprotease, and there is a metal ion existence to function, protease content in macrophages. Only 1/10 of neutrophils is only inhibited by α1-AT, but in turn, α1-at hydrolysis can be loses the effect of anti-HNE.\\nWhen the bronchi-pulmonary infection occurs, alveolar macrophages and neutrophils are aggregated and activated under long-term stimulation of paper cigarettes and other hazardous substances, and the elastic protease is released. When the content and activity of the protease exceeds the local lung tissue When the inhibitory performance of protease (α1-AT), the elastic harden protein is degraded, causing lung tissue ablation, alveolar interval, expanded in the alveolar cavity, the small airway lost the support of the surrounding interval when exhaling, resulting in The occurrence of emphysema.\\nFurther, during the occurrence of emphysema, neutral granulocytes and alveolar macrophages generate and release oxygen free radicals, oxidize the active core methionine in α1-AT to form sulfoxide, thereby resisting protease activity. It is significantly reduced, and the α1-AT activity of smokers is only 60% of non-smokers, so smoking can destroy the balance of protease-resistance to protease systems, promote the occurrence and development of emphysema.\\n3. Genetic factor\\nThe occurrence of emphysema is related to genetic factors. The normal human serum is genetically genetically genetically inherited according to the normally stained genetic process. In the genetic process, the vast majority of normal people are purely consisting of 2 M alleles. Jidi, genetic expression type is PIMM, the α1-at serum concentration of the carrier is normal (> 250 mg / dl), and the positive son of 2 Z-type alleles, PIZZ is a phenotype, and the serum α1-AT is only 10% ~ 15% (<50mg / dl) of normal people, carrying this genetic phenotype, only about 1:2000 (0.05% ~ 0.07%) in the caucasium; in addition, it is related to α1-AT lack The homogenic phenotype is PISS, as for two different allele combinations, the genetic phenotype is more PIMZ (4% ~ 4.4.7%), followed by PIMS (0.5%) and PISZ. 0.08% ~ 0.14%), the remaining heterozygous phenotype is more common, according to the investigation of 3724 aware of the country, the α1-AT genetic phenotype is still PIMM, no 1 case of PIZZ homozygous, other types such as PIS and PIMZ The incidence of emphysema such as PISZ is not high, so the qiocoma caused by the lack of hereditary α1-AT is not important in China.\\n4. Pathological changes\\nGeneral examination, see the excessive expansion of the lung, elastic decrease, the lungs can't be retracted, the appearance is gray or pale, the surface can be seen in the surface, and the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the air suction, the interval is narrowed. The elastic fiber is thinned or broken, the alveolar wall is thin, the alveolar hole is expanded, alveolar cracked or forming a large bubble, and the pulmonary vascular vascular vascular vascular with the fine branch tracheal is inflammatory, and the medium-membered smooth muscle edema, denaturation and necrosis, lump chamber stenosis Blocking, due to alveolar rupture and inflammation erosion, the number of pulmonary blood tubular beds is reduced, and the pathological changes of fine branch tracheal during emphysema are the same as chronic bronchitis.\\nThe obstructive emphysema can be divided into the following three types according to the part of emphysema and lung leaflets.\\n(1) Small-type emphysema: more common in the upper portion of the lung, is due to the end of the end of the tube or the primary respiratory fine branch of inflammation, the distinction of the distinction, the distal secondary respiratory fine branch trachea is expanded. It is characterized by the central district of the capsule expanded breathable trachea (Figure 3).\\n(2) Full small leaf type lungs: It is diffusely infringes all the lungs, but the lower part is more common, and it is due to the end of the end and lung tissue, that is, the expansion of the alveolar tube-pulmonary sac and alveolar due to respiratory fine branch tissue. It is characterized by a small vapor saculation, spread over the lungs (Fig. 4).\\n(3) Hybrid emphysema: There are two types of pathological changes in the same lungs, and in the case of small leaf, the lung tissue expansion in the peripheral area of \\u200b\\u200bthe leaflet.\",\n",
       " \"Causes\\nThe pneumonia-pneumonia is a minimum of the most organized anaerobicity between bacterial and viruses. Mainly spread through respiratory tract. The mycoplasma passes through the mucous fibrous layer of the host respiratory mucosa, which is adhered to the mucosal epithelial cells on the cell membrane, and the adhesion is related to the end structure of the P1 protein of the pneumoniae surface. When this adhesive factor is attached to a respiratory mucosa epithelial cell, the release of toxic metabolism can result in dimmed, and cell damage.\\nIn my country's pediatric pneumonia, it has occurred in winter or winter and spring seasons or climate change, and the season of colds, the south sometimes has a peak in summer or in summer and autumn. Air pollution, indoor crowding, indoor ventilation, etc. is the cause of child pneumonia, and various respiratory infectious diseases, children diarrhea, malnutrition, anemia, and disease, etc. can be the inner factors of pneumonia, and these children have pneumonia, condition It is often heavier, the disease is also longer, and it is easy to be delayed.\\nPathogenesis\\nAt present, the pathogenesis is mainly due to the mucosa epithelial cell due to mycoplasma passage through the mucosa epithelial cell, and the adhesion is adhered to the end structure of the P1 protein of the pneumoniae body, when this adhesion is attached to the respiratory mucosa When epithelial cells, the released toxabine product can result in dimmed, and cell damage.\\nAfter infecting the pneumoniae, the body fluid immunization can cause body fluid immunization and cellular immune response. The body-liquid immune response is a specific IgM antibody, and then IgG antibodies, lasting for a long time, a secreted IgA antibody generated by the nasopharynx, which can effectively inhibit pneumonia. Mycoplasma and respiratory epithelium are combined with respiratory IgA antibodies more direct relationships than the antibodies in serum. The local antibodies on the infection defense are important, and local immunization is also used, and local cellular immunity is also played. Because of the initial infection Children are sensitized to cause heavier clinical manifestations in the time of re-infection, indicating the relationship between the disease and the generated hypersensitated infection infected with pneumoniae.\\nThe pathological changes are mainly bronchitis, capillary bronchitis and interstitial pneumonia, tube wall edema, thickening, mucus and even purulent secretions in the bronchial, bronchial and fine branch, and the mirror as an acute fine bracure There is a small amount of edema and macrophages, which can have a small amount of edema and macrophages in the alveolar, and the wall of the tracheal wall is edema, congestion, and monocytes and lymphocytes infiltration, neutrophils, neutral cells, peeling epithelial cells, and cell disasters, There is lymphocytes and monocytes in the vicinity of alveolar across, and severe visible alveolar necrosis and transparent membrane lesions are meticulous.\",\n",
       " \"Infection is the most common cause of bronchial expansion. Pulmonary tuberculosis, cycle cough, adenovirus pneumonia can continue to bracket. Aspergillus and mycoplasma and pathogens that can cause chronic necrotic bronchial pneumonia can continue to expand the bracket.\\nOne or more immunoglobulin defects can cause bronchial expansion, one or more IgG subclasses lack usually accompanied by repeated respiratory tract infections, which can cause bronchial expansion. IGA defects are not often accompanied by bronchial expansion, but it can coexist with IgG2 subclass defects, causing pulmonary repeated pus infections and bronchial expansion.\\nIt is the most common hereditary disease that causes bronchial expansion to cystic fibrosis. In addition, it may be due to the weak connective tissue development, and the horse's square syndrome can also cause bronchial expansion.\\nThe cilia structure and function are an important reason for bronchial expansion. Kartagener syndrome is three syndrome, namely internal organs, sinusitis and bronchial expansion. This disease is accompanied by abnormal cilia functions.\\nForeign objects have long-term existence of chronic obstruction and inflammation in the airway, and secondary bronch tracheal expansion.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe bronchial expansion can be divided into columnar, capsules, and mixed shape according to its form. The congenitality is mostly a capsule. The tube wall destroyed in the columnar expansion is lighter, the bronchial appearance is not significantly increased. Only in columnar expansion at the end, with the progression of the condition, bronchitis is expanded to peripheral lung tissue, resulting in its damage and fibrosis, forming a capsule expansion in the distal end, in a honeycomb, often sputum retention and secondary infection, The cyst is further expanded, and the inflammation spreads to the neighboring lung substance, causing different degrees of pneumonia, small abscess and small leaf lungs.\\nBronchial expansion is more common in the lower leaf, the left lower leaf air tube is relatively slender, the angle of the main branch is large and the heart, blood vessel oppression, the drainage is not smooth, and the infection has more opportunities, so the lower left leaf broncho is expanded more than the right lower leaves. The left bronchial opening is close to the lower leaflet broncho, which is susceptible to the infection of the lower leaf. Therefore, the left lower leaf is expanded simultaneously with the tongue broncho, and the leaf bronchial opening in the right lung is fine. Inside, outside, there are three groups of lymph nodes around the front, Therefore, non-specific or tuberculous infection is often swollen, and it is oppressed to the right middle leaf bronchi, so that it is blocked, and the bronchial expansion is called a neutral syndrome.\\nThe small pulmonary artery in the bronchial expansion site is often thrombus, and the blood velocity is supplied from the bronchial artery in the pathogenic region. The pulmonary artery and bronchial artery branches are often expanded, distorted and anastomotic branch increased, and small blood vessels are formed under the tube wall mucosa. Damaged, rupture, becoming the pathological foundation of bronchoctilation.\\nThe pathophysiological changes of bronchial expansion depends on the range and properties of the lesions. Since the lungs have great reserve power, such as the limitations, there is no effect on the body, the respiratory function can generally change without significant changes, the columnar expansion on the respiratory function is less affected. And the cystic expansion is easily obstructive pulmonary swollen, such as the wide range of lesions, mainly manifested to obstructive ventilation disorder, low lung volume, low gas flow rate, uneven inhalation gas distribution, physiological shunt increase, ventilation / blood flow Proportional disorders, increased from the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery, the traffic support, the dissection of the lungs also increases, often leads to hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and advanced diseases, with alveolar capillaries, and increased pulmonary circulation resistance, At the same time, hypoxemia is heavier, ultimately leading to pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary heart disease, and even heart failure.\",\n",
       " 'Multi-Pneumonia occurs when winter and spring season and climate change, some South China is in the summer. Indoor living crowding, ventilation, air dirt, and more pathogenic microbes, which are prone to pneumonia. Bronchial pneumonia can be caused by bacterial or viruses.\\nPneumonia is prone to infant and young children is due to the characteristics of respiratory systematic understanding: such as tracheal bronchial tank stenosis, less secretion, fracture, and pulmonary elastic tissue development, rich blood vessels, easy to congest, interstitial development, alveolar number Less, the lung contains less gas, easy to block the mucus. In this age stage, immunology also has weaknesses, and the defense function has not been fully developed, and diseases such as infectious diseases and malnourished diseases are prone to disease. These intrinsic factors not only make infants and young children tempted pneumonia and are more severe. The immunity of infants under one year is very poor, so pneumonia is easily diffused and delays the two lungs, the age and strong childhood, but the reactivity is gradually mature. Enhanced infection, pneumonia often occurs a large lesion, such as limited to a leaf for large leaf pneumonia.\\nAny pathogen that can cause upper respiratory tract infection can induce bronchopneumonia but is based on bacteria and viruses, of which Etthal Societium epidemia RSV is most common. In the 1990s, developed countries such as the United States generally vaccinated B-type influenzemophili (HIB) vaccine, and the pneumonitis caused by Eppermophilus was significantly reduced. Generally, most of the bronchial pneumonia is due to 90% of bacterial pneumonia, other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus collaborates, colorectal psec, psec, pseudoma, psec, psessatus, is less. At least 86 pneumococcus have a variety of serotypes. Therefore, the current score is not very common on the meaning of treatment. Pneumococcal Types of Pneumococcal Type 14,18,19,23, Toxic Pneumococcus pneumocysts with a capsule containing type-type specific polysaccharide, thus resisting phage, and informed pneumococcal pathogenic carriers are spreading Infection, the disease is more important than pneumonia, and this disease is generally distributed. However, in the collective tricotogenic institution, there may be epidemic beta hemolytic streptococcus, often serve as a generous staphylococcus positive bacteria that causes solidified enzyme positive in the measles or average cough, is a common pathogens in children with severe pneumonia, but white morpococcal pneumonia. In recent years, there have been increased pneumonia caused by trend influenza, which is often developed in bronchitis capillary bronchitis or sepsis, and 3 years ago. The pneumonia caused by Escherichiae bacteria is mainly seen in newborns and malnourished babies. However, in the case of a large number of antibiotics in recent years, this disease can be used in the process of morbus pneumococcal and copper and pseudomonas pneumococcal pneumocompans in other serious illnesses in the process of other serious diseases. Most of the pneumonia is due to viruses, mainly for adenoviral respiratory syphilic flu virus paralyzles often concurrently bacterial pneumonia, but measles viruses themselves can also cause pneumonia, encephagrats with bacterial infection Determination of measles virus interior bronchial pneumonia can also be caused by certain types and pneumonia colostrum in the green streptococcus.',\n",

The main insect media viruses classified in the mulctic virus, there is the eastern massan scroll virus, the western Human Bananitis virus and the Venezila, which is mainly distributed in Africa and the Americas. It is classified from a pharmaceutical virus, forest encephalitis virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, St. Louis cerebritis virus, Sinao virus, etc.\\nIncluding A-form, a hepatitis A, Class Class Class A and delta hepatitis A virus, and hepatitis virus refers to pathogens in viral hepatitis. Human hepatitis virus has a division, hepatitis B, non-A-non-B and Diwi virus. The hepatitis A virus is spherical, free of encapsulating, nucleic acid is a single-stranded RNA. The hepatitis B virus is spherical, has a bilateral housing structure, an outer layer, a general virus, a nucleic acid is a double-stranded DNA. Among the non-hepatitis B viruses and di-hepatitis virus are currently under research.\\nIt is a 1-dimensional type 1 virus in the Rabdovirus rabies (Lysavirus), and 2 to 6 \"rabies related viruses\" are currently only found in Africa and Europe. Rabies virus in wildlife (wolf, fox, 鼠, bat, etc.) and domestic animals (dogs, cats, cows, etc.). People are mainly infected by a sick beast or poisonous animal.

Direct effect of virus\\nAfter the drug is injected into the blood circulation, the virus can be carocarditis. The virus is directly infringed by the blood flow. It is also known as the virus replication period. It is the early virus actively replicated and directly active myocardium in myocardial cells. Damage and dysfunction, some people can infect Koxac B virus 3 days, that is, the myocardium has been discovered in necrotic lesions. After 5 to 7 days of infection, there is an obvious inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis, and the viral infection is caused by pathogenesis Mainly by the receptor of the body cell membrane, it has been confirmed that the receptor of Carka B-type virus is positioned on the 19th chromosome of the human, and there is a receptor of Carka, A-type B, Type A, and This type of viral information can be translated, so that the type of virus can proliferate, replicate in myocardial cells, resulting in myocardial injury, in addition, the virus may also generate toxins on topically, resulting in dissolving, necrosis, edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, so, Most scholars believe that patients with acute outbreak viral myocarditis and viruses 1 to 2 weeks, the virus directly infringes myocardium, causing myocardial damage may be the main pathogenesis, which is: from the autopsy found that viruses exist in myocardium, The virus inoculation by myocardial isolation can cause the disease, the degree of neutralizing antibody droplet in the serum in the serum, in addition, in the acute phase, the patient or animal\\'s heart muscle can be separated from viruses, viruses The fluorescent antibody examination results are positive, or the viral particles are found during electron microscopy.\\nSecond, the immune response is for most viral myocarditis, especially chronic myocarditis. At present, the disease is mainly due to immunological metamorphosis, and the experiment is no longer found in myocardium after 9 days of human virus myocarditis, but myocarditis continues. It shows that the immune response plays an important role in the incidence. Some of the other symptoms of viral infections are slightly relaxed, and myocarditis is very serious. Some patients have the symptoms of myocarditis in the virus infection. There is a period of time, and some patients may appear. The antigenic antibody complex was found, and the existence of the immune mechanism was suggested. In the experiment, mouse myocardial cells were infected with a small amount of Koxac virus, and the cytotoxicity was not significant, such as using the same kind of immunocytes, cytotoxicity, such as pre-pre- The cytotoxicity is not enhanced with the anti-spleen antibody and supplement of the anti-rosbee antibody and supplement. Experiments show that there is a cell-mediated immune mechanism in viral myocarditis. The study also suggests that cytotoxicity is mainly mediated by T lymphocytes, clinically, viral myocarditis, Eclovirus, lymphocyte conversion rate, complement C Compared with the normal human, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-cardiac antibody, and anti-complement is high, and the detection rate of normal people is high, indicating that the immune function is low in the viral myocarditis, and recently, the viral myocarditis is found to be vivo and alpha interferon. It is also significantly lower than normal, the gamma interferon is higher than normal, and it also reflects that there is a cellular immune loss, mice experimental myocarditis, the infection of the immunosuppressant cyclosporomethymycin A, the disease increases and mortality increases, 1 week after infection The administration reduces the mortality.',\n",

The pathophysiological changes produced by mitral valve stenosis can be divided into two phases:\\n1. The first phase is chronic pulmonary sedation, both pulmonary veins and pulmonary thinvascular high pressure period.

At this time, the blood flow can only be pushed by the pressure of abnormally increased the left room and the left ventricular. . As the left room pressure is further increased, the left room has expanded, and the diaphragm and pulmonary blood vessels are also elevated due to the valve between the left, and the pulmonary veins, the pulmonary vein and the pulmonary membranatic blood vessels are expanded and congested, resulting in chronic lungs Obstructive congestion. The patient can have no obvious symptoms in the rest, but when fatigue or emotional excitement, due to increased heart rate, the blood capacity of pulmonary veins and pulmonary membranes, the lungability is reduced, the ventilation resistance of the respiratory tract increases, can cause labor breathing Difficult, intervals of parity or hemoptysis.\\n2, the second period is the pulmonary hypertension (the right chamber increases or the endage period). Severe pulmonary congestion can cause pulmonary hypertension by three mechanisms: 1 initially increased the pulmonary hypertension; 2 The initiative pulmonary arteriosclerosis; 3 pulmonary small arteries were developed by functional contraction into equipment quality stenosis and hardening. When the blood volume of the pulmonary circulation exceeds the capacity of the pulmonary cycle, the pulmonary pressure is gradually increased. When the pulmonary artery pressure exceeds 60 mmHg, the right ventricular emptying was severely hindered, and the right room was often raised at the end of the right room. In this case, physical activity, emotional excitement, tachycardia, pregnancy, etc., the pulmonary venous pressure exceeds normal plasma colloidal hydraulic pressure, and acute pulmonary edema may occur.

Secondary mitral valve prolapse: It may be related to the following causes.\\n(1) Hereditary Connected Tissue: MARFAN syndrome; ingredient is incomplete; adhesive polyglycanosis (MPS), Hurler syndrome (MPSI-H), SANFMPPO syndrome (MPSIII)]; EHLERS- DANLOS Syndrome (EDS); Elastic Dopoid Tunage, etc.\\n(2) Rheumatoid disease: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); nodule polyphalitis; recurrent multihalitis.\\n(3) rheumatoid venomitis.\\n(4) Viral myocarditis.\\n(5) Expanded myocardial disease, hypertrophic myocardial disease.\\n(6) Coronary heart disease (papillary muscle syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, nipple muscle or tendon break, room wall tumor.\\n(7) Congenital heart disease (room, interval defect, arterial catheter is not closed, EBSTEIN malformation, correction of large angiogenesis.\\n(8) Other: Precision syndrome, Von Willebrand disease, congenital Q-T extend syndrome, athlete's heart and direct back syndrome.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\n1. Pathological changes:\\n(1) Primary mitral valve: It is due to the increase of the matrix of the flapped fiber layer and (or) mucus-like degeneration, so that normal fibers and elastic components are separated and broken, and the naked eye is too long. Increased and thickened, and the translucent lifting is high, and the lesions are treated with the leaves. The front and rear leaves are treated simultaneously. Due to the excessive leaf of the leaves, the wrinkles of the leaves can result in scalops and umbrellas. The above variations are also tired and supported under the valve, the annulus can be expanded; the tendon is elongated, thinned and fragile, so that the tendon is easy to break, thus aggluating the mitral valve.\\n(2) Secondary mitral valve deanling disease can have the following changes:\\n1 MARFAN syndrome in hereditary tissue disease can have mitral tidal mucus degeneration,\\n2 Rheumatic disease 43% of anti-nuclear antibody is positive, suggesting that this disease may be related to connective tissue diseases,\\n3 cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease often caused by tendon, nipple muscle, inflammation, injury, causes tendon elongation, shrinking, necrosis, breaking and nipple muscle direction axis displacement, and left ventricular wall chamber The mitral valve is lost to the constraint.\\n4 Congenital room separation may be overweight with the right ventricular diastolic period, causing the chamber interval deformation, thereby displacing the rear nipple muscle.\\nMost mitral valves are not or only mild mitral reflux, and the left ventricular diastolic pressure is increased, and the blood-blood fraction decreases, the left atrium and left ventricle increase.\\n2. Pathophysiology: Mitral valve procedure is tympily, after the occasional influence, when the leaves and ventricular contractions are simultaneously influential, the normal mitral valve is closed, but the excessive leaf leaves the valve to further upward Left ventricle, due to excessive tendon rosion suddenly pulled the mitral petal to the pole, the valve activity suddenly stopped, and the mitral valve was significantly displaced, which was not normal. When closed, the short-term reflux noise can be caused, which can produce mitral valve closed blood dynamic changes, and the two-pointed valve large area must not have Kraky and noise, a few patients. The valve performs sexual degenerative changes or buckles, or both at the same time can cause severe mitral valve reflux.\\n3. Pathogenesis: Some mitral valve patients often behave as syncope. If there is one of the risk factors of sudden death, the mechanism is related to the following aspects:\\n(1) Surr quasi-pulley disconnect: two-pointed vadepe, various types of ventricular arrhythmia in various types of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with mitral valve are unclear, Barlow, etc., the ventricular arrhythmia may It is caused by the local ischemia caused by the papillary muscle, and WIT will return the mechanism to mechanical stimulation based on the experimental results, which is due to the sudden drop of nipple muscle stretching and diastolic matrix.\\nSome scholars have found that many patients have a tip torsional ventricular tachycardia that occurs on the basis of Q-T interpolation, and found:\\n1 Many symptoms of patients with mitral valve are prompting independent neurological abnormalities or adex glandular nerve tension;\\n2 Symptomous mitral valve patients with 24 hours of diaper orcharide excretion is greater than normal;\\n3 After injection of isopropymine in patients with symptoms, the heart rate increases and the QT interval extension is large, suggesting an atypical QT syndrome of adrenaline dependence.\\n(2) Flowing tract obstruction: patients with mitral valvip dragons often combine left ventricular outfrigence:\\n1 In the systolic period, the co-directional movement of the two-pointed front and the interval can cause hemodynamic obstruction;\\n2Barlow et al. Diagonal and hypertrophic sorceretic coexistence, Sophyst, etc. Atrial fibrillation can occur.\\n(3) Simultaneous Brain Ischemic Employment (TIA): Barnett discovered 40% of transient cerebral hybrid ephesion in 45 years old.\\n(4) Survey such as bacterial endocarditis (IE): Macmahon, etc. The population is 52 times higher. If the mitral valve is obviously shrink, the risk of infectious endocarditis is higher, Macmahon, etc. found, and the diced valve prolapse infection of the zoom-in-treatment Inneriitis is 13 times higher than the mitral valve with non-contraction period, and the risk of infective endocarditis in patients with mitral valnees over 45 years old is more dangerous than the age of 45. Patients with valva, male mitral valve is 2 times higher than female infectious endocarditis, and 89% of the mitral valve, 89% of the mitral valve.\\n(5) Valve reflux: Many researchers have found that in places where rheumatic heat has disappeared, mitral valve is the most common cause of mitral vanes, and a group of 97 cases of severe mitral vanes in foreign countries.

This disease, the pathophysiological changes of the disease are as follows:\\nFirst, the cause\\nThe cause of various types of pulmonary arterial stenosis has different causes, and in the 6th week of embryo development, the artery start is separated into the aorta and pulmonary artery, and the original nodules of three valves are formed in the pulmonary artery chamber, and grow to the cavity Further, the absorption of thinning forms three pulmonary foil valves, such as an obstacle of the valve in the growth process, and the three valve junctions are fused into a mouth-shaped mouth of a dome-shaped protrusion, i.e., forming pulmonary flap, while pulmonary flap development, heart The cone portion of the ball is absorbed into a right ventricular outflow channel (ie, the funnel portion), such as developmental disorders, flow out of the epicyclic muscle hypertrophy or fat bucket across the chamber wall and the interval, forming the right ventricular flow, the row, and the other embryo During the development, the sixth pair of arterial bow is formed to be left and right pulmonary artery, and the distal end is connected to the pulmonary vermiche, and the proximal end is connected to pulmonary artery, such as the developmental disorder, which forms a pulmonary branch or pulmonary artery stenosis.\\nSecond, pathological changes\\nPulmonary stenosis: three valve junctions fused into a dome-shaped thickened diaphragm, in the mutant cavity, the petals is fish-shaped, can be located in the center or biased side, the small petal hole is only 2 ~ 3mm, generally petals The holes are around 5 to 12 mm, and there is a slightly raised ridge in the junction of the leaflet. Most cases are fused to each other, a small number of double valve fuse, the flap is often thickened, there is small The nodule, even the calcification, the pulmonary artery rings generally have different degrees of narrow, and the right ventricle is due to blood flow obstruction, and the deductive right ventricular flow of the epithelial steps and the right ventricular expansion will lead to three The sharp valve is closed.\\nThe pulse mortal dryness can exhibit a narrow closing clip shape, which can often extend to the left veneer, and the pulmonary artery is significantly greater than the aorta.\\nThe stenosis of the funnel is two types: the first category is a narrow stenosis, below the conical portion, and the right ventricular flow path forms a fiber muscle diaphragm between the chamber burst, separated by the right ventricular. The heart cavity, the upper wall is slightly swelling a funnel to the third ventricle, below the muscle hypertrophic right ventricle, the center of the two spacers has a narrow pore, the size is about 3 to 15 mm, this diaphragm type Striosis is often coexisting with arterial valve stenosis, called hybrid stenosis, the second type is a toroidal stenosis, mainly manifested as the right ventricular flow of the wall layer diffuse muscle hypertrophy, forming a longer narrow heart channel, which is narrow It is often accompanied by a non-pulmonary artery ring and the pulmonary artery dysplastic development, so the non-pulmonary stenosis is expanded.\\nThird, physiological changes\\nRegardless of the type of pulmonary artery, the right ventricular blood is blocked, the pressure in the right vember cavity is increased, the degree of increase in the degree of pulmonary pulmonary veins is proportional, and the pressure in the pulmonary artery remains normally or slightly decreased, and thus the right chamber There is a cross-vulneous pressure stage in the pulmonary artery, which increases with the degree of pulmonary arterial stenosis, such as the cross-vulgar pressure step is 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg) below the mild pulmonary artery, the impact on the right heart Not large, when the cross-valobing pressure step is between 5.34 to 13.33kPa (40 ~ 100 mmHg), the right ventricular blood blow is influenced, and the right heart excision is reduced when the right ventricular blood is reduced.

It is believed that protagonistic hypertension is a polymeric genetic disease. According to reports, high blood pressure patients and high blood pressure family history, blood pressure has transmembrane electrolyte transport disorders, and there is a hormone-like substance in serum, which can inhibit Na + / K + -TPase activity, to reduce sodium potassium pump function, resulting In terms of Na +, Ca2 + concentration in intracellular, the arterial SMC contraction is reinforced, and the density of Adrenergy Receptor is increased, and vascular reactivity is enhanced. These are all contribute to the increase in blood pressure. Recent studies have found that vascular tension (AGT) genes may have 15 defects, and the normal blood pressure is defective, while three specific parts of Hypertensive patients have the same variation in the AGT gene. Brothers or sisters with high blood pressure can get the same copy of the parent's AGT gene. In patients with hypertension in genetic deck, the plasma angiotensin level is higher than that of the control group.\\nIn general, a population of high average salt is high, and its blood pressure is increased or the average blood pressure is higher than that of the amount of salt. WHO recommends that each person's daily salt per day should be controlled below 5g.

The highest urination is Tianjin (242 mmol / 24h). This is related to the high sodium and low potassium of Chinese diet. Potassium can promote sodium, eat a large number of vegetables to increase potassium intake, and it is possible to protect the adverse effect of arteries from sodium. Calcium can reduce the boiling effect of sodium, and my country's diet is generally low calcium, which may increase the effect of sodium / potassium to blood pressure. Increased intervention studies in increased diet calcium consolidation showed that the increase in calcium reduced blood pressure in some patients.\\nAccording to the survey, social psychological stress is closely related to hypertension. Stressful life incidents include: parents early, lost love, widow, family member car accident death, sick, family rupture, economic political impact. Hypertension in hypertension is higher than that of the stimuli of life events. It is believed that social psychological stress can change the balance of hormones in vivo, which affects all metabolic processes.\\nRenaloidal cells secrete antihypertensive lipids such as prostaglandins, antihypertensive neutral neutron liposin, and sodium sodium dysfunction may be related to hypertension.\\nIt is generally believed that the excitability of the sympathetic nerve fibers of the font of the artery is an important neurological factor in the disease. However, there are two categories of fibers after the sympathetic ganglion:\\n1. Stripase fibers, and the proposal is a neuropeptide y (NPY) and norepinephrine.\\n2, expanded fuel fiber, delivery quality is calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and P material. These two fiber function imbalances, that is, when the former is functional than the latter, the blood pressure is increased. In recent years, the relationship between central neurotransmitters and neuris, and various regulatory peptides and hypertension have become a very active research area. According to reports, CGRP may inhibit the release of norepinephrine in rats in rats, which may inhibit the release of nephrene in adrenaline when they are stimulated at adrenal gland. It has been reported that the sodium peptide (A, B and C) is separated from the mammalian heart and the brain, and there is a litter peptide family in the human body. Recently, new progress has been made in the study of local renin-angiotensin systems (RAS). The mouse renin gene (REN-2 gene) was injected into rat ovarocytes in a micro-injection to form TGR (MREN2) 27 of transgenic rats, which was extremely high. The Northern blot hybridization proves that REN-2 transgene expression is expressed in adrenal, blood vessels, gastrointestinal and brain, and can be expressed in thymus, reproductive systems and kidney. Since it is expressed in the vascular wall, the angiotensin of the blood vessel may be increased, thereby generating high blood pressure and blood vessel SMC fat.\\nBlood pressure regulation mechanism\\nA variety of factors can cause blood pressure, and the cardiac pump is strengthened (such as the increase in cardiac shrinkage, etc.), the blood increases per second, and the other factor is that the main artery lost normal elasticity, becomes stiff, when the heart When the blood is pumped, it cannot be effectively expanded. Therefore, each time the blood flow is passed through a space than normal, resulting in an increase in pressure, which is high blood pressure in atherosclerosis, causing arterial wall thickening and change The reason for the stiff seniors, due to the stimulation of hormones in the nerves and blood, the systemic small artery can be temporary contraction, which also causes the blood pressure to increase the blood pressure, which may result in increased liquid capacity in the cycle, which is common When kidney disease, the kidney does not sufficiently discharge sodium salt and moisture from the body, and the blood volume in the body increases, resulting in an increase in blood pressure.\\nConversely, if the cardiac pump is limited, vascular expansion or excessive body fluid is lost, it can cause blood pressure drop, which mainly through kidney function and autonomic nervous system (the part of automatically adjusting the body in the nervous system) Change to regulate.\",\n",

When reaching a certain extent, the heart expansion is limited, the filling of the ventricular diastolic period is reduced, and the amount of heart beat is lowered. At this time, the compensation mechanism of the body is increased by raising the venous pressure to increase the filling of the ventricles, increase myocardial shrinkage, and accelerate the heart rate. Make an increase in displacement; increase the surrounding arterial resistance to maintain blood pressure, such as the perception of the permeable solution, further increase the pressure in the heartbacle, the right room is diastolic, when the pressure is equal to zero, the heart plug or heart pack plugging That is, when the intracellular pressure and right chamber pressure rises to the left ventricular diastolic pressure level, the above-mentioned compensation mechanism has a significant cardiac plug expression, that is, an elevated venous pressure does not increase the filling of the ventricle, a radiosphere fraction.

       " 'In recent years, it has been found that the onset of GRAVES disease is related to autoimmunity. The hyperthyroidism caused by other lesions is characterized or still unclear, and is hereby being described below:\\nImmune factors (30%):\\n1956 ADAMS et al. Found that long-acting thyroid stimulation (LATS) effect is similar to TSH, which is an immunoglobulin (IgG) produced by B lymphocytes, is an autoantibody against thyroid, can be used with thyroid subcomponellation The composition is bonded, and the excitatory methytobubilized epithelium is secreted with thyroid hormone. In patients with hyperthyroidism, 60% ~ 90% Lats increased, and later found LATS-P substances, also a thyroid tissue of IgG, only excited people, but also known as human thyroid stimulation immunoglobulin (HTSI), more than 90% of patients with hyperthyroidism is positive. .\\n1. Direct evidence of immune mechanism of hyperthyroidism is:\\n(1) In humoral immunity, a plurality of antibodies having a variety of anti-thyroid cell components are known, such as thyroid irritating antibodies (TSH receptor antibodies), or TSH receptor antibody (TRAB) for TSH receptors, or TSH receptor antibody. Its related organizations are combined to further activate CAMP to enhance thyroid function. Such antibodies can cause neonatal hyperthyroidism through placental tissue, or not thoroughly, antibodies continue positive after hyperthyroidism, leading to hyperthyroidism.\\n(2) Cellular immunity, these antibodies were confirmed due to B lymphocytes. Hyperthyroidism patients have presence of sensitization T lymphocytes for thyroid antigens, and lymphocytes in hyperthyroidism can produce lats, PHA excitatory T lymphocytes, and then stimulate B lymphocytes after activation of phytoplasm (PHA). Immunoglobulin, such as TSI, etc., such as TSI, etc. Organ-specific autoimmune diseases are caused by inhibitory T lymphocytes (TS) function defects cause immune regulation disorders. Therefore, the immune response is a complex result involving T and B lymphocytes and phagocytic cells. It is contemplated that the inhibitory T lymphocyte function relating to genetic defects is related to the reduction in the function of the TS function, which can cause T cell sensitization to cause B cells to produce TRAB and cause hyperthyroidism.\\n2, indirect evidence:\\n(1) There is a large number of lymphocytes and slurry cell infiltration after thyroid and eyeball.\\n(2) The number of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood circulation increased, which can accompany the lymph node, the liver and the spleen mesopathic tissue hyperplasia.\\n(3) Some autoimmune diseases in patients can also occur at the same time or in their relatives.\\n(4) Patients and their relatives of blood anti-thyroid antibody, TRAB and anti-gastrointestinal antibodies and antternal antibodies are positive.\\n(5) There is IgG, IgA and Igm of IgG, IgA and Igm in the hypervisor.\\nThe cause of the development of GRAVES disease is currently considering that the immune monitoring and regulatory function of patients TS cells has hereditary defects. When there are factors such as foreign spiritual trauma, or infection factors, in vivo immunization is destroyed, \"banned\" cells Lost, generating TSI B lymphocyte hyperplasia, functional variation, secreted a large amount of TSI autoantibody under the action of TS cells. There are many mentally trauma and family history, which are induced by induced factors. In recent years, the Caucasian hyperthyroidism HLA-B8 has been 2 times higher than normal. Asian Japanese HLA-BW35 has increased, and China\\'s Chinese HIA-BW46 has an increased sensibility, B13, B40 is more obvious, these are noted.\\nGenetic factors (20%):\\nClinically discovered that family-friendly diseases have many cases, and the same egg double fetus has reached 30% ~ 60%, only 3% to 9%, and the family history investigates, there can be other kinds of other species Thyroid diseases such as thyroid dysfunction, etc., or TSI positive in family relatives. This shows that the GRAVES disease has a family genetic tendency, which may be a commonly stained heritage, or a commonly stained syndrome, or a polymeric genetic.\\nOther causes (10%):\\n(1) Differential hypervisible thyroid or adenoma, in the past, it is considered that the disease is not autoimmune disease, and IgG, TSI, IATS and other immune evolution were detected due to blood. In 1988, he reported that a single knotted fertilizer and microburn body antibody was reported in China in 1988, the positive rate was 16.9% (62/383), and the positive rate of more than 54.7% (104/190), these nodules The thyroid tissue is not adjusted by TSI, which has become an autonomous functional hyperthyroidism or hyperthyroidism thyroid nodules or adenoma. At present, thyroid adenoma and cancer injustice are also considered to be due to tumor genes.\\n(2) Pituitary tumor secretion TSH increased, causing pituitary hyperthyroidism, such as the hyperthyroidism accompanying the TSH secreted tumor or limb.\\n(3) Acute thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, painless thyroiditis, etc. can be accompanied by hyperthyroidism.\\n(4) Exogenous iodine increases hyperthyroidism, called iodine. Such as hypodel patients are too much, taking thyroid tablets or left trimelloin (L-T4) can cause hyperthyroidism, and a few patients take amiodate drugs can also cause hyperthyroidism.\\n(5) Ectopic endocrine tumors can cause hyperthyroidism, such as ovarian tumors, cashmell cancer, digestive system tumors, respiratory tumors and breast cancer, etc., which can cause clinical hyperthyroidism.\\n(6) Albright syndrome in clinical manifestation is poorly structural structure, skin pigmentation, blood AKP rises, can be accompanied by hyperthyroidism.\\n(7) A family-friendly high globlast (TBG) can cause hyperthyroidism, this disease can be related to the lack of genetic genetic genes or related drugs.\\nPathogenesis\\nGraves\\' s hypothyroidism, symmetry, can also be non-symmetrical, external complete envelope, smooth surface, rich blood flow, filter bubbles, cylindrical, among the cubic Lymphocytes and slurry cells infiltrated, liver, spleen, thymide and lymph nodes such as hyperplasia, and lymphocytes in peripheral blood; reflect the pathological foundation of autoimmune, electron microscopic bubble epithelial cells microeprow, increased pour droplets , Gelco\\'s fertilizer is large, and the rough inner texture is increased, and the luminosid is increased, and the thyroid is active.\\nHyperthyroidism, the body is involved in the system, the body is abbeatable, edema, horizontal lines disappear, emulsion, and the cell nuclear is degenerative, myocardial degeneration, myocytes can occur, monocytes infiltration, adhesive polysaccharide deposition, eyeball Outstanding, intra-eye mymial water swelling, myocyte fatness, lymphocyte infiltration, adhesive polysaccharide deposition, optic god edema or atrophy Adhesive polysaccharide dyeing, there is a monocyte increase, more occurrence in front of the tibia and lower limbs, liver swollen, liver cells are fat, the liver gland is reduced, the endocrine glands can be affected, the gonad and the adrenal gland can occur in severe adensoles Functional reduction, osteoporosis and osteopoly decompsification are relatively common, osteoclast activity is enhanced, and the bone absorption is more than bone shape.

       " \"The virus RNA in vivo in vivo infection is a risk factor for viral myocarditis, and the mouse animal test shows that Koxac virus can dissolve myocyte cells. The intestinal viral protease can cause myocardial cell skeleton destruction. And this change is recognized as the main characteristics of expanding cardiomyopathy, the damage of viruses on cardiomyocytes can occur in a period of high virus titer (Carka B1, B4 viral infection), can also occur in viruses (Coxschi B3 virus) After the immune response after infection, the damage of the virus to myocardial tissue can be directly damaged, and the immune mechanism can be damaged. When the viral RNA continues to be in myocardium, T lymphocytes can infilt myocardial tissue.\\nStudies have shown that the low level expression of the viral gene can cause chronic conductive myocardial injury. When the virus RNA has more than 90 days in myocardial, myocardium can exhibit pathological changes like expanded myocardial disease.\\nWhen the body's defensive ability is lowered, the body can carry a chronic virus carrying state, during this chronic process, the virus can be present in the spleen, the liver, pancreas and systemic lymph nodes, and the hazard is not directly invading the myocardium, but is the immunity of the body. Reaction; at the same time, the virus RNA continues to be replicated, producing a large number of viral RNA without invasive but with antigenicity, and an immune response to the body, causing myocardial injury.\\nAt present, the immune-mediated myocardial damage is an important mechanism of DCM onset.\\n1 body fluid immunization: autoantibodies of multiple antimodromosome can be detected in serum specimens in patients with expanded myocardial disease, including anti-mitochondrial ADP / ATP carrier antibody, anti-β1-adrenergic receptor antibody, anti-M2 choline energy receptor Antibody, anti-heat shock protein antibody, antibodies, anti-branched chain alpha becomic acid dehydrogenase, bckd) complex antibody, and antibody-like protein antibody, etc., these The antibody plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.\\nA. Antibody ADP / ATP Carrier (Ant) Antibody: The study found that ANT and pathogenic protein have a common antigenic determinant, such as ANT amino acid sequences 27 to 36 and Koxaci B3 virus arginine sequences, 1218 to 1228, By cross-reaction causes autoantibodies, there is also a study that viral infection causes mitochondrial isolation antigen release, or causing changes in myocardial antigen, or activates self-reactive T lymphocytes by bypass, to induce autoimmune responses to mitochondria.\\nAnti-Ant antibodies can inhibit the ATP / ADP transport of myocardial mitochondria, leading to myocardial cell energy metabolism, impair myocardial function, ANT and calcium channel protein may also have the same antigen determinant, anti-Ant antibody can be with calcium channel protein on myocardial cell membrane Combined, inhibiting calcium passage inactivation, promoting calcium, causing intracellular calcium overload, leading to cardiomyocyte denaturing necrosis, in other words, the calcium superload caused by ANT antibody activation ICA is one of the reasons for myocardial injury in patients with DCM.\\nB. Anti-β1-receptor antibody: β-receptor G protein coupling film receptor The lump enzymes and protein alkases make it degraded, and the lysosomes can be combined with a nuclear receptor containing a main tissue compatible complex (MHC) class molecule. If the degraded receptor polypeptide can be formed from MHC molecules The complex can be transported to the surface of the membrane, which is delivered to the auxiliary T lymphocyte (TH) receptor, activated TH, activated TH and B lymphocytes interact, producing specific antibodies for autostatical polypeptide molecules. Under normal circumstances, myocardial cells do not express MHC class molecules. Only when they have immunoactive, MHC-type molecules are expressed, viral infections can induce cardiocytes express MHC-class molecules, so that cardiomyocytes have become antigen, in addition, viruses A common antigenic determinant having an β receptor molecular structure can cause anti-β receptor antibody production by simulation mechanism.\\nThe anti-β1 receptor antibody activates the Ca2 channel of the receptor, increasing the internal flow of cardiomyocytes, causing calcium overload, causing myocardial cell damage, and anti-β1 receptor antibody can increase cardiomyocytes CAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK) activity The ratio of the cytoplasmic and plasmid PK activity is significantly improved by combining the beta receptor, resulting in a cytoplasmic and plasmid CAMP-dependent PK activation, achieving a positive and vapority, and the authors believe that anti-β1-receptor antibody can affect myocardial cells Information transfer, disorderly disorders of the receptor adjusted cardiocyte metabolism, and the number of β-receptors of myocardial cells are lowered to induce myocardial damage.\\nC. Antibody antibody: At present, there are two mechanisms that cause immune responses in patients with expanded myocardial diseases, producing antibodies antibodies: a. Viral infection or other causes of myocardial tissue necrosis caused myoglobin release and Exposure, trigger autoimmune of the body; b. Antigenic determinant with a virus molecule and myoglobin.\\nD. Anti-M2 cholinergic receptor antibody: M2 cholinergic receptor is a protein located on a cardiomyocyte membrane, a G protein coupled membrane receptor, synergistic to the beta receptor together to regulate myocardial cyclic enzymes. The activity and ion channels, adjust the heart function, and anti-M2 cholinergic antibody has a cholecular energy-like action to reduce the increase in adenosine (CAMP) concentration caused by isopropyrine by isoprotine in the cavic adrenalin. Slow down the shrinkage frequency of ventricular muscle cells, slowing the maximum speed of the ventricular pressure, slowing the heart rate, this inhibitory effect caused by anti-M2 cholinergic receptor antibody can be offset by choline antagonist Atropine or in neutralizing antibody The production of the antibody may be due to the viral infection to make the M2 choliner receptor into its own antigen, excitation autoimmune reactions.\\nE. Other antibodies: In addition to the above anti-myocardial auto-antibodies, there is also an anti-mitochondrial M7 antibody, anti-BCKD complex antibody, anti-BCKD complex antibody, anti-bacteroid antibody, anti-bacteroid antibody, antibody, etc. .\\nAlthough approximately 30% to 40% of the expanded cardiomyopathic patients have organ and disease-specific autoantibodies, some patients do not have anti-autoantibodies, which may be related to the following factors: a. Distortion of cardiomyopathy It is a multi-factor disease, lack of autoimmunity, cause damage to cellular immunity or caused by other factors; b. The heart's autoantibody may be the early signs of the disease. As the prolonged extension will disappear; c. Different expansion Different self-antibodies can have different autoantibodies, which can produce negative results due to different types of detection methods and detection; D. Production of autoantibodies is related to human leukocyte antigen.\\n2 Cellular Immunity: In the expanded myocardial disease, cell-mediated abnormal immune response is characterized by damage to lymphocyte function, changing the proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations and activation of immunocytocytosis systems, expanded myocardial patients periopathic T-cells ( CD3), inhibitory / cytotoxic T cell (CD8) significantly decreased, adjuvant / induced T cells (CD4) have no significant changes, and studies have shown that cytotoxic T lymphocytes have an in vitro dissolved viral infection with cardiomyocytes, viruses After infection, a polypeptide called a T cell receptor, T lymphocyte identification and the binding of this receptor can exhibit a polypeptide, T lymphocyte identification and such receptor, which can cause cardiomyocyte damage; use anti-T cell receptor antibody to damage myocardial cells Reduce, in addition, natural killing cells can also secrete perforin to form aperture cells.\\n3 Cell factor role: DCM patients have a significant increase in inflammatory factors, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α / interleukin (IL) -10 ratio is positively correlated with plasma adrenaline levels; serum TNF receptor (STNFR) level Left ventricular size; the increase in interleukin content and myocardial weight and the degree of myocardial fibrosis are positively correlated, interferon γ and TNF-α can induce cytochemical adhesion molecules - 1 (ICAM-1) surface surface, the latter in myocardium Plays in the coupling of cells and lymphocytes.\\nThe family's genetic tendency of expanded cardiomyopathy is not good with hypertrophic myocardial disease, but genetic factors still have a certain role. The family chain of expanded myocardial diseases is more common, and 20% of patients have also presented more than 20% of patients. Evidence of expanded myocardial disease suggests that the family's genetic is relatively common.\\nTypical family myocardial diseases are neuromuscular disease, such as Duchenne muscle malnutrition, with X-chain genetic Becker chronic conductive muscle malnutrition, both of which are anti-microcompanies (a cytoskeletal protein) mutation To, recently, in a family of cardiomyopathy, non-skeletal myopathy, there is a lack of cardiac catalytic regions related to the anti-muscle atrophy protein gene, which is reported that family myocardial disease is related to mitochondria Abnormal, such as Kearns-Sagre syndrome: cardiomyopathy, eye muscle paralysis, retinal lesion, small brain commissal, except for abnormal myocardin and metabolism, genetic factors also affect the trigger of anticoretal immune responses, with members of the same family in viruses Reports of heart failure after infection or in pregnancy, most familial cases are commonly genetically bodied, but the disease is extremely heterogeneity in hereditary, has been reported to have a common-stained hidden genetic 49 and X-chain genetics , There is a type of family-friendly X-chain expandable cardiomyopathic gene-based promoter region and the lack of the first exons encoding the dystrophin, the latter protein is a muscle cell skeleton. One of the above, according to this, the lack of cardiac muscle malnutrophy protein caused by the above gene changes is the cause of expanded myocardial disease. In addition, there is also a mutator in the mitochondrial DNA, as for patients with no obvious family chain. The genetic susceptibility of expanded myocardial disease is still unknown.\\nThere have been many dyeing statues related to the dominant genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetics of family, including chromosomes (Q32, P1-Q1), 2 chromosomes (Q31), 2 chromosomes (Q33-34), 6 chromosomes. (Q12-16), chromosome (Q13-22), chromosome (Q11), chromosome (Q14, Q22), and discovery of DCM patients with mitral valve DCM patients at 10 Number (Q21-23).\\nPathogenesis\\nIn recent years, the study shows that most expandable myocardial diseases are related to viral infections and autoimmune reactions. The industry has found that viral myocardial disease can evolve into expanded myocardial diseases, and the endometrial myocardial biopsy specimens of myocarditis and expanded myocardial diseases can be found. The serum of the intestinal virus gene, the serum of patients with expanded myocardial disease can detect a variety of antimodromalt, such as anti-ADP / ATP carrier antibody, anti-β1 adrenergic receptor antibody, anti-M2 cholinergic receptor antibody and anti-muscle Bulin heavy chain antibody, etc., can also detect the intestinal viral gene fragment, viral infection, and immune response damage to the main pathology of the current expanded myocardial disease. In addition, genetic factors may also play a role.\\nExpansion-type cardiomyopathy is a long-term role of multiple factors that cause final results of myocardial damage (the main causes of DCM, infection or non-infectious myocarditis, alcoholism, metabolism, etc. may be related to the incidence of expanded myocardial disease, short Hair myocardial injury (such as contact with toxic substance) may be lethal in certain cardiomyocytes, but the residual myocardial cells will increase the load, the compensatory hypertrophy, this compensatory change is still in the early days. Maintain the overall function of the heart, but will eventually appear as the contraction of myocardium and diastolic dysfunction, but myocarditis has both irreversible cardiomyocytes, and the reversible myocardial suppression mediated by cytokines, certain factors (such as alcohol) though Not directly impairing myocardial cells, but if long-term effects can still cause severe heart dysfunction, many damage will also accumulate the heart fiber bracud system, affect the compliance of myocardial, and participate in the occurrence and development of ventricular expansion.\",\n",
       " \"The study believes that the disease-specific natural environment is related to the onset of Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease. The chemical substances in the environment use soil-food chain to the human body, and the research includes two aspects: one is poisoned (including sputum, humic acid, nitric acid Salt, etc.), two for the lack of chemicals (selenium, magnesium, molybdenum) in the diet, said that the disease has obvious regional, the soil, water quality and food lack of some human body need for some human body, such as the survey of the disease. Selenium, molybdenum, magnesium, etc., thereby interfering with myocardial metabolism, causing myocardial or injury.\\nSome characteristics are characterized by biofactor infection, such as separating multiple viruses from Kshan's myocardial tissue, including Koxac B group viruses, serological studies also show about 1/3 of acute and 67.9% The antibody in a double serum Kehachi B group virus in patients with submerged Kessi patients is 4 times higher than that of the separated token B group virus inoculation of low-selenite, damage and lesion test The rate is also significantly higher than that of the normal selenium group, the virus is damaged by the diaphragm of myocardial, and the cytotoxic T cell, B cell, T-assisted cell proliferation is strong, so the biological cause study believes that the onset of Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease It may be a basic factor in low selenium, and some cases can be onset when there is a virus in Coxschi B group, and the autoimmune response initiated by this is further aggravated with myocardial damage.\\nPathogenesis\\nTesting mechanism\\n(1) Biological geochemical diseases: Theoretically believes that the etiology of Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease is present in soil of water and soil, and the food chain acts on the human body, lacks or imbalance through amino acid, vitamin and trace elements, causing myocardial damage.\\n1 Internal and external environment, low selenium: internal and external environment is closely related to Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease, a large number of studies have shown that Kshan disease occurs in low selenoids, and the selenium content in food is significantly lower than that of non-disease, hair and blood. The selenium content is significantly lower than that of non-disease residents, showing insufficient selenium content in the internal and external environment of the disease, through Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Sichuan and other places to prevent Krishan disease test, and found that selenium is urgent There is a significant effect on the incidence of submerged Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease. In addition, there is a change in metabolic changes in low selenium and the patients in Kshan patients and the patients. (GPX) The content is significantly lower than those of the non-disease zone; plasma lipid peroxide (MDA), free fatty acid (FFA) is significantly higher than that of non-disease zone; the free radical content and hemoglobin oxidation rate in patient red blood cells are significantly higher than that Patients and diseases are also higher than those of non-differential district, but low selenium cannot fully explain all epidemic characteristics of Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease. If it is not all low selenium, there is a mountain disease; although the disease is generally low, the disease is only A small part of the resident; the selenium level of the disease is not changed accordingly by the annual and season of Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease; there is no obvious difference between the same ward and non-sick, selenium and blood in the hair, therefore At present, it is believed that selenium lack is an extremely important regional factor in the harsh disease, but is not only a factor.\\n2 Vitamin E (VE) lack: In recent years, the content of antioxidant in VE components is generally less than the non-disease area in the diseased area, and the disease is also confirmed The total amount of α-TOCO and VE in the plasma (including Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease patients and healthy people) is significantly lower than that of non-disease-health people, and the total amount of α-TOCO and VE in the patient's red blood cell membrane is also significantly lower than that Normal people in the disease, indicating that the patients in Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease are generally in a low VE state, and the levels of multi-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAS) in the diet are generally higher than that of the non-disease zone, and the ratio of α-TOCO (Mg) and PUFAS (G) is generally low. In the non-disease area, the PUFAS in the biological body depends on the protection of VE, suggesting that the crowds of the disease may have relatively insufficient α-TOCO, thereby further reducing the anti-oxidation capacity of the body.\\n3 Protein and amino acids: the intake of residentiality and plant protein in the disease is significantly lower than that of non-disease zone; the essential amino acid content in the wards is lower than that of the non-disease region, the disease-containing area plasma containing sulfur amino acid (S-AA) Such as deck of methionine, enabling selenine in replacement methionine from the diet to participate in protein synthesis, causing selenium to exert the physiological function, S-AA or glutathione precursor, and it will lead to valleys Cashperide synthesis is reduced, but the latter is not only a specific substrate of the GPX reaction, but it is itself a free radical scavenger, which is visible, low selenium, S-AA intake and low VE can cause body antioxidant capacity. decline.\\n4 Dietary high manganese: Previous studies have shown that there is a relatively high manganese phenomenon in most low selenium areas, and experiments have shown that exogenous manganese can accumulate in vivo, resulting in degradation of selenium selenium content, Affecting the antioxidant capacity of cells, especially red blood cells and myocardium, and the combination of pirate and manganese, interacting, can further reduce the antioxidant capacity of myocardium, and aggravate myocardial damage.\\n5 Dietary Low Calcium: Dietary averaged 1, calcium intake is particularly obvious, and animal experiments have found that low calcium can increase the cardiocal necrosis caused by low selenium, so dietary low calcium may also be important in Kanshan disease composite. Role, this can explain why Ke Mountain happening occurs more women and children in the growth period of calcium demand.\\n(2) Biological cause:\\n1 intestinal virus: A variety of viruses can be isolated from the myocardial tissue and other organs of patients with Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease, such as Kessach viruses A9, B1, B2, B3, B4 equivalents, EVI virus 120 , The 7th type of adenovirus, etc. % ~ 90%, and found that about 1/3 of the epitonic effect, the antibody titer of acute patients is 4 times, and the positive rate of Koxakovirus IgM in the serum is as high as 69.4%, indicating that most Kshan patients have Newly occurring intestinal virus infections, domestic use of in situ nucleic acid hybridization and sleeve polymerase chain reaction, found that there are intestinal virus RNAs in various Kshan cases, and the positive rate is 85.7% and 90%, respectively. These research results suggest that it is necessary to pay attention to the intestinal virus, especially the role of Koxac B group virus infection in the ruthless disease.\\nForeign animal experiments show that in the case of selenium and low Ve, mice are more likely to infect Koxac viruses, infected with Koxaki virus, with myocardium under low VE conditions, it can be seen that the disease is severe; usually does not cause a benign in myocarditis The strain CVB3 / 0 also causes cardiomyopathy in mice with low VE; while separating the virus obtained from its myocardium, it can also cause significant myocardial injury when vaccination into mice that have been supplemented via the cells. Low VE condition, cvb3 / 0 may have a phenotypic transition, and there are similar situations in selenium, such as comparative analysis of nucleotide sequences from the celtoprosis from the lack of starch-free rats, found that there are 6 (Cap 234, 788, 2271, 2438, 3324, 7334) nucleotides have a point mutation, and these mutations are consistent with the known psythmic amphoteric strains CVB3 / 20, CVB3 / M1 nucleotide sequence, in addition , Selenoprotein, such as GPX, not only highly biological cells can be synthesized, CVB3 can also be encoded, but the partial amino acid sequence of GPX is homologous, and the capsid protein VP3 can form a fusion protein, the aforementioned selenium or selenium protease gene knockout CVB3 There is a mutant site of / 0, there is a region, so some people have speculated that the mutant strain may also be related to the functional deactivation of this GPX fusion protein.\\n2 Squares: Some people extract sicklein bacteria from the diet, and speculate on the causes of grain contaminated sickleus as Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease, but the beaded Squama has in the Kshan disease district and the non-disease area. Distribution, and is not advantageous; the difference in pollution between the bacteria is greater than the difference in the same food between the disease and the non-disease zone; the distribution of pollution and the regional distribution of Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease is also unacceptable; The toxicity of Summyosin is independent of selenium nutrient state of the dyed target; selenium or supplemental VE does not inhibit or mitigate the toxicity of bacterus bacteria, which does not match the practice of selenium prevention Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease; No myocardial enzymes and pathological changes in Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease were seen in myocardial damage, so the role of skeletal bacteria in Kshan disease was considered to be further discussed.\\nIn short, it is currently believed that Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease is a local myocardial disease caused by composite pathogenic factors. The basic path is due to superposition of biological geochemical factors and dietary nutritional factors, causing low selenium and closely related VE (α) - Tao phenol) Introducing, low selenium, low VE generally acts on crowds of the disease, usually only causes myocardial metabolism or potential subclinical damage, resulting in sharp necrosis and clinical onset of myocardial, have some induced factors ( Conditional factors) Participation, these factors do not have obvious regional differences, but can have an important influence on clinical ones, annual issuance of Kehan \\u200b\\u200bdisease, and many seasonal issues, such as Kessach virus infection is an important condition. factor.\\n2. A large number of autopsy has confirmed that the lesionic characteristics of various Kshan disease in Northeast China, North China, Northwest and Southwest China is basically consistent.

       " \"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by slow conjugated obstructive emphysema is most common. COPD is the most important cause of elderly pulmonary heart disease, followed by bronchial asthma, bronchial expansion, severe tuberculosis, dust, chronic diffuse pulmonary fibrosis (including idiopathic fibrosis and secondary pulmonary fibrosis ), Pulmonary radiation treatment, node disease, allergic alveolar inflammation, eosinophilic granuloma, intravariatous diffuse mesoplasmic pneumonia, alveolar hard stone symptoms.\\nLess, severe spine, lateral convex, spinal tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, pleural extensive adhesion, and thoracic, severe thoracic, severe pleural hypertrophy, obesity is insufficient, sleep breathing Obstacles and neuromuscular diseases such as polio, can cause thoracic activity, lung pressure, bronchial distortion or deformation, result in limited lung function, not smooth, lungs repeated infection, pair pulmonary, or fiber Chemical, hypoxia, pulmonary vascular contraction, stenosis, increase resistance, high pressure of pulmonary artery, and develop into pulmonary heart disease.\\nVery rare, accumulating allergic granuloluma, extensive or repeated multiple pulmonary hydraulic embolization and pulmonary arteriitis, and unknown primary pulmonary artery high pressure, the pulmonary veins can be narrow, obstructive, The increase in pulmonary vessel resistance, the pulmonary hypertension and the right ventricular load are too heavy, and it is developed into pulmonary heart disease. It is obedient to pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, such as tumors, aneurysms, etc., can also be seen in primary pulmonary hypertension.\\nRepeated pulmonary infection, hypoxiamia and toxalmia may result in myocardial damage and arrhythmia, and even have a heart failure; the primary alveolar ventilation and congenital oxide deformity, sleep apnea syndrome can also lead to a lung source Heart disease; other can be found in pulmonary resection and high altitude hypoxia, etc., these diseases can produce hypoxemia, which increases lung vascular contraction, leading to high pressure of pulmonary artery, and develops into pulmonary heart disease. In addition, poisoning, sexually transmitted systemic sclerosis, dispeliscent lupus erythematosus, dermatitis, etc. can also be induced.\\nPathogenesis\\n1. Pathogenesis: The disruption of pulmonary hair and blood tube beds with chronic pulmonasthasis makes the area of \\u200b\\u200bblood vessels, and the hypoxia and respiratory acid poisoning caused by gas flow occurs can cause pulmonary arteriosclerosis, and the secondary red blood cells caused by chronic hypoxia. And the increase in blood sticking consistency can lead to an increase in pulmonary circulation, the pulmonary hypertension, the right heart load increase, the right ventricular hypertrophy is expanded, and the development is pulmonary heart disease.\\n(1) Pulmonary hypertalloculation: Pulmonary hypertension, PAH is an important pathophysiological stage of chronic pulmonary heart disease, early pulmonary hypertension, if the cause can be removed in time, or appropriately symptomatic treatment, it is possible to reverse the lesions or block Further development of lesions; advanced pulmonary hypertension, lesions are in an irreversible stage, and difficulty treatment.\\n1 Pulmonary vascular quality changes: anti-bronchitis surrounding inflammation, interstitial inflammation, resulting in a neighboring pulmonary artery branch, causing thickening, stenosis or fibrosis, so that the area of \\u200b\\u200bpulmonary micro-blood is greatly reduced, pulmonary circulation resistance Increased, long-term pulmonary circulation resistance, can enable the middle layer of the small artery, increase the lung circulation resistance, resulting in a malignant circulation, in the factors affecting the high pressure of pulmonary artery, although there is a certain role, but the degree is lighter, range Small, the increase in pulmonary artery pressure is not obvious, only when the pulmonary tube bed area is reduced by more than 70%, the pulmonary pressure is significantly increased.\\nWhen severe COPD, the alveolar is overflated, and the interval of most alveolar is fused to form a pulmonary bulw, which also leads to a reduction in the alveolar capillary bed, and the lungs in the alveolar of emphysema increase, and the internal pressure of alveolar is also increased. The capillary of the oppression of the alveolar wall makes it narrow, in addition, obstructive pulmonary swollen, the exhalation phase of the patient is prolonged, can be 5 times that of the suction phase, the pressure in the alveolar is more significantly increased, oppressed the lungs The blood vessels and hearts make the blood of the pulmonary artery not smoothly perflow, or it can affect pulmonary pressures.\\nIn addition, pulmonary vascular diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension, repeated epidermal embolus embolus, pulmonary fibrosis, dust, etc., can cause pulmonary vascular stenosis, occluding, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and development is pulmonary hypertension.\\n2 lung vascular functional changes: hypoxic pulmonary injury contraction, which is currently the most widely and in-depth mechanism, mainly to summarize the following aspects.\\nA. Sports Factors: Pulmonary inflammation can activate inflammatory cells including hypertrophy, eosinophils, basophilic granulocytes and macrophages, release a series of inflammatory media, such as histamine, 5-hydroxylamine (5-HT), Angiotensin 11 (at-II), and peanut tetrakenoic acid (AA) metabolites, including white triangie, thromboxin (TXA2), prostaglandin F2 (PGF2), pre-rollerin (PGL2) and prostaglandin E1 ( PGE1),,, For example, the proportion is increased, and pulmonary vascular contraction can be caused.\\nB. Organizational factors: hypoxia can directly increase the permeability of the pulmonary blood tube smooth muscle membrane to Ca2, increase the internal flow of CA2, muscle excitement - shrinkage coupling effect is enhanced, causing pulmonary vascular contraction, alveolar gas CO2 voltage pressure (PAC02) The rise can cause local pulmonary vascular contraction and bronchial diastolic to facilitate adjustment of the ventilation / blood flow ratio, and to ensure the oxygenation of pulmonary venous blood, there is an imbalance of pulmonary vascular adrenaline receptor after hypoxia, and the contraction of pulmonary vascular vesicles.\\nC. Neurological factors: hypoxia and hypercarbonate can stimulate carotid sinus and aorta chemical sensors, reflectively through sympathetic nerve excitement, catenolamine secretion increases, and shrink pulmonary artery.\\n3 Pulmonary vascular reconstruction: the pulmonary vascular changes of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension mainly manifested in a distinct muscle layer of less than 60 μm, greater than 60 μm pulmonary artery, endometrial fiber hyperplasia, inner membrane The longitudinal muscle buck is increased, as well as the elastic fiber and collagen fibrous matrix, which makes the blood vessels, the resistance increase, the structural changes of these pulmonary vasons are called transodeling, and the mechanism may be in an oxygen-like stimulating factor. A variety of growth factors are produced inside and outside the lungs, thereby producing a series of changes.\\n4 increased blood volume and blood viscosity increase: COPD can have long-term chronic hypoxia, and the growth of red blood cell growth is increased, resulting in increased secondary red blood cell production, so that pulmonary vascular resistance increases, COPD patients also have pulmonary micro-blood tube bed area Reduced factors such as pulmonary vascular compliance, the compensatory expansion of the vascular volume is significantly limited, and thus the pulmonary blood flow increases, the pulmonary hypertension can be caused.\\n(2) Changes in right heart function: The factors affecting the right heart function of chronic lung disease are mainly pulmonary hypertension, and after the weight of the right ventricular is increased. After the weight of the right chamber increases, the ventricular wall is increased, and the amount of myocardial oxygen increases; coronary An increase in arterial resistance, reduced blood flow; and increased pulmonary vascular input impedance, the ability to decrease, and damage to the right heart function, in addition, hypoxemia has direct damage to myocardium, and the right chamber is excessive in chronic pressure load, right The ventricle wall has a hypertrophy to overcome the increased post-load, thereby maintaining normal pump function.\\nWhen the respiratory tract infection, hypoxia weight or other reason, the pulmonary artery should be further increased, and the right ventricular discharge amount is not complete, the right ventricular discharge is incomplete, and the residual blood remaining at the end of the contract is too much, so that the right ventricular diastolic end is increased. , The right ventricular expansion is aggravated, and finally causes heart failure.\\n2.

The right ventricle of the housing company also shrinks, so the right atrium is simultaneously received from the vena cava, the atrial, the right ventricle and the three-dimensional vanes return flow, resulting in an increase in the capacity of the right heart, enlarges the room, and the right atrium pressure increases. Finally causing heart failure, there is a case where the ovoid is unstoppart or atrial separation, the right heart is higher than the left atrium, and the right to left is generated, and the body circulating arterial blood oxygen content decreases purple and pestle (toe).

       " 'There are many reasons for shock, and there are many ways to classify, from the characteristics of their etiology and pathophysiology, from the characteristics of their etiology and pathophysiology.\\nCardial shock is narrowly referring to the serious stage of acute myocardial infarction (see acute myocardial infarction), acute myocardial infarction, clinically, with blood pressure reduction, skin perfusion, renal blood flow, center The performance of important organ microcirculation failure such as neurological dysfunction, while eliminating drugs such as analgesic, vascular dilatation, diuretic), less eating, body fluid loss or insufficient fluid caused low blood pressure, etc. That is, the diagnosis of cardioperative shock can be considered.\\nGeneralized upper source shock also includes acute myocarditis, bulk pulmonary infarction, papillary muscle or tendon break, perforation, severe aortic valve or pulmonary stenosis with light or moderate tachycardia, acute heart package, tension Sex sprulle, atria mucous tumor, severe mitral or three-dimensional stenosis with a shock caused by light or moderate tachycardia, and ventricular rate sustained.\\nLow blood volumetric shock is a large amount of blood loss in vivo or intravascular blood loss (internal bleeding or external bleeding), water (such as vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal fistula, diabetic acid poisoning, etc.), lost blood (such as large area burns, Reasons such as peritonitis, trauma and inflammation, have reduced blood volume, which is characterized by low venous pressure, increased peripheral vascular resistance and tachycardia, hemorrhagic shock, traumatic shock and burn shock are low blood volume. Severe shock (see \"Upper Gastro\").\\nInfectious shock is also known as poisonous shock, with insufficient tissue of blood flow, usually caused by Gram-negative bacilli infection, its circulating function is not in the increase in peripheral vascular resistance, blood flow sludge is stagnant, blood discharge Reduce and tissue hypoxia (a small number of vascular resistance, small moving, intravenous short circuit open, no reduction in blood row blood, but the microcirculation perfusion is reduced), the cause is mainly seen in Gram Negotic bacilli infection (eg Sepsis, peritonitis, necrotic cholangitis, etc.), poisoned bacteria, poisonous pneumonia, outbreak epidemic cerebrospinal fluoritis, epidemic bleeding heat, etc .; shock is not due to bacteria directly invading blood flow, but with bacteria Endotoxin and its cells are released into blood related to blood, in patients, elderly, malnutrition, diabetes, malignant tumors, and long-term use hormones, immunosuppressive drugs and anti-metabolism patients, (see \"Infectious shock\").\\nAllergic shock is a rare type of shock, and the body has allergic reactions to certain biological products, drugs or animals and plant sensitizers, sensitizens and antibodies in sensitized cells, the latter release Out of 5-hydroxylamine, histamine, combinating peptide, etc., causing surrounding vascular dilatation, capillary bed expansion, plasma oozing, relatively insufficient blood volume, plus often there is a throat edema, and the breathing caused by bronchogenesis is difficult, so that the chest cavity The internal pressure is increased, and thus the amount of blood is reduced, and the blood volume is also reduced (see \"Allergic Shock\").\\nNeurogenic shock is a severe obstacle to arterial resistance, loss of vascular tension, causing blood vessel expansion, resulting in shock caused by peripheral vascular resistance, effective circulating blood capacity reduction, and is simple due to the shock caused by neurological factors, can be seen in the trauma, drama Pain, cerebrospinal injury, drug anesthesia, intravenous injection of barbye drug, gangfensive agent or other antihypertensive drugs and mental trauma.\\nOther have an endocrine function (adrenal cortex function reduction, thyroid dysfunction, etc.) and bucks caused by hyperthyll hyperthyroidism (such as thyroid crisis, hyperparathyroidism, cancer and primary aldosterone increased diseases).\\nClinically infectious shock, cardiometric shock, low blood volume shock, allergic shock is more common.',\n",
       " \"(1) Causes of the disease\\nThere are many factors that cause neonatal hypoxic ischemic brain damage:\\nOxygen\\n(1) Periodic asphysque: including prenatal, maternity and postpartum asphyxia, intrauterine hypoxia, abnormal placental function, umbilical cord prolapse, pressure and winding neck; abnormal childbirth, stagnation, fetal position is abnormal; The development is abnormal, such as premature birth, excessive production and intrauterine development slow development.\\n(2) Respiratory pause: Repeated apnea can cause hypoxic ischemic brain damage.\\n(3) Severe pulmonary infection: newborns have severe respiratory diseases, such as severe pulmonary infections can also cause disease.\\n2. Ischemia\\n(1) Severe cycle system disease: heartbeat stop and heartbeat, severe congenital heart disease, severe heart failure, etc.\\n(2) A large number of blood loss: a lot of blood loss or shock.\\n(3) Severe intracranial diseases: such as intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral edema.\\nNewborne suffocation in HIE causes, leading to the main cause of this disease, pre-prenat and mass suffocation accounted for 50% and 40%, and other reasons account for about 10%.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\n1. Dive reflections in the body when hemodynamic change is hypoxic, in order to ensure the blood supply of important life organs (such as brain, heart), cerebrovascular expansion, non-important organ vascular contraction, this automatic adjustment function makes the brain in mild No damage during short-term hypoxia, such as hypoxia continues to exist, cerebrovascular autonomous regulation function is lost, the reaction ability of the cerebral artery on the change of the perfusion pressure and CO2 concentration, forming a pressure-related passive cerebral blood flow regulation process When the blood pressure is lowered, the cerebral blood flow is reduced, causing the ischemic damage of the arterial edge.\\n2. Brain cell energy metabolic failure is hypoxic during hypoxia, can only rely on glucose oxygen-free yeast to produce energy, while producing a large amount of lactic acid and accumulates within the cell, resulting in cell acidosis and cerebral edema, due to no oxygen The solution produced is far less than aerobic metabolism, which must be repayed by adding sugar-based decomposition and glucose intake, causing secondary energy failure, causing cell membrane to impairment of cell membrane, sodium intracellulum, calcium and water. Increase, causing cell swelling and dissolution.\\n3. Reperfusion injury and oxygen free radicals are hypoxic ischemia to increase and decrease, and a large amount of oxygen free radical is accumulated, damaged cell membrane, protein, and nucleic acid, resulting in structural and function of cells, oxygen The free radicals are mainly harmful to the body, and the xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase are mainly concentrated in endothelial cells of the microvascular, resulting in damage to the blood vessel endothelium. Sexual cerebral edema.\\n4. CA2 internal flow hypoxic hypoxic calcium pump activity is reduced, resulting in calcium flow, when the concentration of Ca2 in the cells is too high, the enzyme being adjusted by the CA2 is activated, phospholipase activates, can decompose film, phospholipid, produce a large amount of peanut tetrane Acid, under the action of epoxidase and lipoxidase, forming a prodrin, thromboxin, and white thirane, nucleic acid enzyme activation, can cause nucleic acid decomposition, protease activation, catalyzed xanthine dehydrogenase to become xanthine Oxidase, the latter is turned into xanthine when recovering oxygen supply and blood flow, while generating free radicals, further agglomerating the injury of nerve cells.\\n5. Neurotoxic effect of excitatory amino acid can cause damage to the sodium pump function, extracellular K deposit, cell membrane continuous decolation, pre-synaptic neuron releases a large number of excitatory amino acids (glutamic acid), The reciprocation of glutamic acid is damaged, resulting in increased glutamate in the synaptic gap, excessively activating the synaptic glutamic acid receptor, non-N-methyl-D-doorpartic acid (NMDA) receptor When activated, NA internal flow, CL-and H2O are also passively entered intracellular, causing rapid death of neurons; when the NMDA receptor is activated, CA2 internal flow can lead to a series of biochemical chain reactions, causing delayed neuronal death. .\\n6. A nitric oxide (NO) bispoint effect NO is also a gas free radical, which can react with O2, producing a peroxidized nitro ion (ONOO-), and further decompose into OH- and NO2-, When the metal iron is present, ONO- can decompose to produce free radical NO2-, OH- and NO2-, in addition, NO can also mediate the toxic effect of glutant, and can also damage mitochondrial, protein and DNA directly causes neuronal injury, oxyxygen ischemia, CA2 internal flow, when the intracellular Ca2 accumulates to a certain level, activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), synthesized a large number of NO, NOS has three different different Subtype, neuronal and inducible NOS mediate early and advanced neurotoxic effects, while NO produced by endothelial cell type NOS can expand blood vessels.\\n. After the performance of delayed brain injury, it is confirmed that hypoxia ischemia can cause two different types of cell death, namely necrotic and apoptosis, delayed neuronal death is essentially apoptosis, in animal model detection Go to a series of apoptosis-related genes.\\nIn short, HIE's pathogenesis is very complicated. The result of a series of biochemical chain responses caused by a combination of various mechanisms, and a large number of studies have confirmed that most neurons are not died in hypoxic ischemia, but died in hypoxia. After several days of blood, this delayed cell death is to prevent or alleviate the intervention starting after hypoxia ischemia.\\nThe pathological changes in Hie are closely related to the premiere of the maternal, the nature and the degree of damage. One is the brain hemisphere damage on both sides: mainly in the full moon, suffocating is incomplete, first of the emergence of blood shunt ( Diving reflection) to ensure heart, cerebral blood supply, with the continuous increase of hypoxia, blood pressure decline, blood flow second re-distribution (intracereal diversion), the blood supply of the brain hemisphere is reduced due to the initial cerebral circulating blood vessels, and the hypertureram The blood supply of brain dry and cerebellum increases due to increased brain circulation blood vessels, therefore, the brain hemisphere is more susceptible to damage, often with severe cerebral edema, the second is basilar festival, hyperthermithoid and brain stem damage: for completeness, twice The compensation mechanism of blood flow re-distribution is invalid, and the brain is damaged by hypertrophenoids and brains, and the damage of the brain organs and the brain hemisphere can not be serious, the brain edema is light, and the white matter around the brain is softened: mainly in premature infants, Side ventricle is ischemia, resulting in deep white tape cell death, often symmetrical distribution, will occur in the ventricular pipelines of the two lower limbs, four is the ventricular pipe film of the ventricular pipe membrane in the ventricle / brain, mainly in premature infants, The ventricular pipelines were bleeding, with cerebral indoor bleeding.\",\n",

Secondary hypertension, hypertension, secondary blood pressure, continuous hypertension, secondary hypertension, is also known as symptomatic hypertension, hypertension, is a clinical manifestation of some disease. I. Secondary hypertension is the most common hypertension in infants and children, acute or chronic processes, neonatal hypertension related to umbilical artery catheter and renal embolism, children with high blood pressure and kidney disease, aortic , Endocrine diseases or drugs, etc., common causes are as follows:\\n(1) Kidney disease: 80% of the secondary hypertension may be related to kidney disease, the most common lesion of hypertension, or known renal hypertension, including: kidney substantive lesions (acute and chronic glomerulonephritis) , Chronic pyelonephritis); congenital kidney disease (polycystic kidney, renal development is not full); renal tumor: secondary renal lesions (connective tissue disease, diabetes); renal blood disease (renal artery and venous narrow, blocking); kidney Peripheral lesions (inflammation, abscess, tumor, trauma, bleeding); hemolytic uremia, etc.\\n(2) Vascular lesions: such as aorta narrow (increased upper blood pressure), multiple vermicitis.\\n(3) Endocrine disease: adrenal cortex, including: cortisol hygrology (Ku Xin syndrome), primary aldosteric alcohol, pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma (secreted tea phenolic substance, is 2 years old The common cause of hypertension in infants under the following infants, hyperthyroidism, hyperthyroidism (high blood calcium).\\n(4) Cerporative brain disease: intracranial tumor, hemorrhage, edema, encephalitis, etc. can be accompanied by high blood pressure, or affect the stability of independent nerves makes sympathetic nerve excitement.\\n(5) Poisoning and drugs: lead, mercury poisoning, vitamin D poisoning, adrenocortic hormones, cocaine, stimulants, etc.\\n2. The cause of primary hypertension is the primary hypertension, which is related to the following factors:\\n(1) Inheritance: According to the statistics of relevant domestic and foreign information, the heritage of high blood pressure is 60% ~ 80%, with age growth, the genetic effect is more obvious, and the normally gland of the normal blood pressure of the parenchymal hypertension is detected. Sui, dopamine concentration, obviously higher than the corresponding control group without high blood pressure family, indicating that there may be have a hereditary sympathetic hyperthyroidism, and the primary hypertension often has obvious family history, 1987-1994 \" The research information of the identification and one-level prevention of hypertension in the young children, indicating that high blood pressure is 6.57 times that has no family history, and there are 40% to 60% of the family history of adult hypertension. It may be with hereditary calcium and sodium ion transport disorders (when NA intake is too much, the cells cannot discharge too much Na, and the Na retention in the vascular wall smooth muscle cells can increase the intracellular Ca2 by the Na - CA2 exchange. The increase in excitability, which ultimately promotes blood vessel contraction, peripheral resistance increased, renin-angiotensin system balance disorder and insulin resistance, etc. ATPase activity, increase the content of intracellular Na, stimulate the activity of sympathetic nerve, increase the renal absorption of sodium sodium, increase the sensitivity of blood pressure, stimulate growth factors (especially vascular smooth muscle), and increase endothelin secretion The normal blood pressure of hypertension has a normal physiological reaction similar to parent. If it is stimulated, the heart rate increases during the competition, and the blood pressure increase is significantly higher than that of the family history. In addition, urinary catenolamine metabolism has increased, sodium load pair The increase in increasing and blood pressure is also significantly higher than those who have a family history. There are children with abnormal reactions in family history. The black species is more than caucasic. The adult is high and low in the plasma.

The blood islands gradually extend and connect each other to form the original capillary plexus, arterial and intravenous origins from time to time the same capillary plexus, and the vascular embryo development process is roughly divided into junction, mesh period, and tube-proof formation. In the stage, in the mesh period, if the expanded blood vessel traffic gather, it can produce arteriovenous fistula, which can be generated, and there are countless parallel blood vessels, and multiple traffic, these traffic is often extremely Small, called micro-vivid vein, and continues to retain an abnormal traffic between the tubular formation, the general circulation of the veins, called the ambient venous fistula, as for the cause of the vascular base development abnormal formation of vascular malformations, there are still many arguments, Some scholars believe that congenital arteriovenous fistula is a chromosome malformation, but Desave and Bessone840 are quenching, only 7 cases have a history of genetic history, early pregnancy, toxic infection, metabolic disorder, fetal position and umbilical cord positions are not normal caused Trauma, can affect normal fetal development, endocrine and plant nervous system regulation and malfunction can also affect the development of arteries, intravenous and lymphatic systems, and the embryonic development of circulatory systems is generally divided into three phases:\\n1 Unexplified blood vessel primitive period: Unexplified interstitial cells form a beam-shaped and has a development of vascular cells, these early capillary cells spontaneously form a tubular structure, biologically similar cells like capillary sources.\\n2 Net-mesh: The original artery and venous pipes begin to differentiate, but the main artery and veins have not appeared.\\n3 blood vessels based on the formation period: mature blood vessel formation, circulatory system embryonic development of any time or development of cycle development, developmental stagnation or abnormalities can cause vascular distortion, wherein the development of mesh development is easily caused by CAVF, expanded blood vessels. Communication, aggregation, and integration, histone communication can often be extremely small, called micro-vapor vein fistula; the development of vascular dry fistula is abnormal to continue to exist in abnormal blood velocity, forming a larger arterial fistula.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nClassification\\n(1) Malan and Puglionisi Classification: Malan and Puglionisi divide CAVF into two types: 1 main vein sputum: there are local or diffuse, low activity or high activity; 2 blood vein hemangi: single or diffuse , Low activity or high activity, and further divide a single main dry, plexous, arterial or limit type as subtype.\\n(2) Szidgei classification method: Szilagyi et al, proposes another simple classification of CAVF by the embryonic development of the surrounding circulation system: 1 Unexplified vascular mesh developmental stagnation causes hemangioma; 2 mesh developmental stagnation causes congenitality Arteriper fistula, according to the size of the abnormal traffic vascular and the portion shown in the vascular angiography, then divided into micro-fistula and large fistula oral venous fistula; 3 vascular dry formation period development is abnormal, resulting in abnormal blood vessels.\\n(3) Vollmar classification: 1976, Vollmar is divided into three types from the perspective of surgery into three types, type I: surrounded by horizontal axon; Type II: surrounded by intravenous intercourse, horizontal axis There are many small traffic supports, and they are involved in local soft tissues and bones.

It can also accumulate central nervous system, including brain and spinal cord, and abnormal clinical manifestations. Although the sexual arteriovenous fistula is rare, it is reported due to a wide range of lesions, and the symptoms of organ compression or vaginal bleeding can be generated, and CAVFs in the lungs, kidneys and digestive tract are also reported.\\n3. Pathophysiology\\nCAVF belongs to a benign lesion, but the biological behavior of malignant tumors, the constant development and spread, often tumored and adjacent tissue and organs, Holman changes the cycle system produced by congenital arteriovenous fistula, using blood flow mechanical principle, ie Blood is like flowing liquid, potential and naturally flowing to low resistance and low pressure, congenital arteriovenous fistula is high pressure, high resistance artery system and low pressure, low resistance, high-capacity venous system Abnormal communication, due to the low resistance of the venous end, make the blood pass through the fistula without entering the capillary bed, producing blood flow dynamics change, according to the portion of the arteriometry, the size and quantity of the pipe diameter, the local and whole body generation Role, the proximal end of the fistula is significantly thicker and distorted by blood flow increases, the artery and venous side conversion increase, the circulating blood volume increases causes the proximal angio of the fistula, and the distal arterial system is not obvious. The blood volume increases, according to the size and corresponding resistance of the fistula, when the ratio of the distal vascular bed resistance is more than the ratio of its proximal arterial resistance, the distal arterial blood occurs counterflow, large chronic arteriovenous fistula, When the fistula resistance is low and the lateral circulation of the fistula, the distal artery can be used as the flow of fistula, and the venous system near the fistula can be used to produce high pressure, causing the entire venous bed to expand and tune, although the mouth can reverse the heart after closing the fistula Expanded and venous expansion, but long-term lesions make the proximal arterial expansion and the aneurysm formation can be developed, and the amount of blood of the shunt depends on the diameter of the fistula, the type and the heart of the heart. The larger the fistula, the greater the heart The closer, the more blood of the shunt.\\nVealain arterialization, vascular wall smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, but no elastic layer, the local effect of arteriovenous fistula is directly related to the size of the fistula, \"stealing blood\", can cause surrounding tissue perfusion pressure Reduce, ischemia, and the venous pressure increase in the distal end of the fistula, a series of clinical manifestations of venous high pressure, including distal vein blood stagnation, intravenous valve function, occasional reverse blood flow, arteriper fistula Systemic performance includes increased blood volume, speeding up, heart expansion, cardiac hypertrophy, diastolic pressure reduction, increased blood capacity, etc., in a small number of blood flow, then blood The increase in quantity can increase the heart rate, the myocardial shrinkage is lowered, and ultimately high-exchanging heart failure is produced, and since the CAVF fistula is much smaller, its effect on the systemic circulatory system is not as obvious.',\n",

In the case of endometritis, the blood culture results have no one. There is a grass green streptococcus. Many scholars at home and abroad have considered that the proportion of Grass Green Streptococcus as an endocarditis has gradually declined, 1958, In 1964, in 1982, domestic scholars reported 69%, 49%, 53%, respectively; Japan wins and filial filial piety reported from 1963 to 1970, China's 323 submerged infective endocarditis patients accounted 71.8%, 1971 ~ 1978 In the year, 679 patients with submerged endocarditis were reduced to 56.7%. During this period, 836 IEs were collected from 25.8%, and 54 cases diagnosed by the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan Medical University, 1990-1995. SIE In 22 cases of blood culture, the grass green streptococcus accounted only 3 (13.6%).

There is a possibility that the valve or heart membrane that is likely to adhere the pathogen, and the normal human bloodstream often has a brief blood flow, bacteria mainly come from oral cavity, respiratory tract, urinary tract, or invaded blood through other routes. Under normal circumstances, bacteria or other pathogens invaded blood flow is eliminated at any time due to the body defense mechanism, and it is not easy to cause submerged infectious endocarditis. When the endocardiosis is particularly ventricular, the collagen fiber under endothelium is exposed. The platelet aggregation and fibrin are promoted, form a sterile platelet protein, which is a must condition for infective endocarditis, plus the surface roughness, bacteria or other pathogenic microorganisms, for it Breeding, breeding provides a foothold, which is prone to subacute bacterial endocarditis.\\n2. The thermitral effect and blood flow can be adhered to the fungal and pathogens experiments that can be adhered to the valve. The largest precipitate ring appears in front of the exit hole, that is, the so-called thermal special effect, according to this effect, the portion of the bacterial or pathogenic microorganism is often in front of the narrow hole of the blood flow, such as the mitral valve close up and uniform infection Sexual intimal inflammation often violates the left room, the interval defect and submerged infective endocarditis is often in the right chamber membrane surface, the aortic valve is stenosis in the aortic membrane surface, the aortic valve is closed. Left room surface, the arterial catheter is not closed in the pulmonary artery surface, etc. Serum complement sterilization and unspeakable affected by platelets, only such pathogens can cause IE, clinically, such as grass green streptococcus, Staphylococcus, enterococci and certain Gram-negative bacilli, etc. against valve or intima There is a strong adhesive force, so it is easy to cause IE. In contrast, such as white-throat, acne shortlum seedlings, etc., there is a minimum of IE.\\n3. Whether the blood flow pressure step is susceptible to SIE in addition to the strength of the temperature and special effect, it is also clearly related to the blood pressure step, when blood flow, this can also explain why heart disease is complicated with anxiety, congestive When heart failure or severe mitral stenosis, it is not easy to happen because atrial fibrillation, heart failure or severity is narrow, so that the blood flow speed slows down and (or) the pressure phase is small, and it is not easy to generate turbulence and jet. The injection effect and the thermitile effect are weaker, which is not conducive to forming a bio, so there is less, for this purpose, it can make a simple classification of the common heart disease easily.\\n4. Effect of immune mechanisms The immunopathological mechanism of infective endocarditis has caused attention, repeated temporary bacteremia causes a specific aggregate antibody, which has caused pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, adhesion to endocardios Or the role of the valve injury, enhance the pathogen invasive ability, the antigen stimulation immune system in serum causes non-specific high gamma globulin, antigenic antibody immune complex to form a rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear factor, anti-myocardial antibody, etc. More than 6 weeks of IE patients with 72% rheumatoid factor, in some cases, such as grass green streptococcus, variability bacteria, the bacterial blood of the collagen, and the serum, non-specific antibody can cause immunoglobulin.

In my country, China has gradually adjacent to the above data.\\nRheumatic heat is a common cause of the aortic stenosis of young patients, and the pathological changes are first inflammatory edema, lymphocyte infiltration and neovascularization, and then the fibrillation of the flap has thickened, accompanied by different levels Fusion, due to the rush and stiffness of the leaves, the valve opening is irregular narrow. Rheumatic aortic diseases often combine mitral or three-pointed lesions. The stenosis of simple aortic valve is relatively rare. Rheumatic aortic valve is very rare in Western countries, and it has gradually decreased in our country.\\nCan be single, bimovi or three-leaf. Single-leaf birth is narrow, the wet fibrosis and calcification are severely increased, causing severe left ventricular outflow obstruction, and children have died within one year. 50% of congenital aortic valve stenosis is two-leaf, 30% is three-leaf. These two valve deformities can have no obvious stenosis in childhood, but abnormal valve structures cause degenerative variable due to eddy current impact, causing rolls thickening, calcification, stiffness, and ultimately leading to narrowing, but also incomplete. Generally, calcium salt deposition is gradually produced on the two-leaf aortic valve after 30 years old. After 50 years of age, there was a significant aortic vane stenosis due to calcification. Therefore, adults simple aortic valve stenosis, especially patients under 60 years old, mostly calcified aortic valves occurring on congenital di-aortic aortic valve. This lesion is characterized by calcification, and the annulus, the annulus and the junction area, often with a vegetable gaby, the aortic valve is often a crack shape, and there is very few aortic valve closing.\\nIt is a degenerative change, accounting for 18% of the elderly patients, and the old agenda of normal aortic valves over 65 years old. Demnicity, fibrosis and calcification, and flap fusion. The apex stenosis is relatively light, and some patients can be associated with closedness.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe main pathophysiological changes after the aortic valve narrowness are the increase in the resistance of the shrinkage period, so that the left ventricular shrinkage is enhanced to increase the cross-valine pressure step, and the normal heart is normal. This gradually causes the left ventricular hypertrophy, causing the left ventricular diastolic phase to decrease, the pressure on the end of the diastolic is elevated; although the blood volume of the rest of the heart is normal, the heart is insufficient during the exercise. When the valve is severely narrow, the cross-valve pressure is decreased, left housing pressure, pulmonary pressure, pulmonary blood tube, and the right ventricular pressure can be increased, and the blood volume is reduced. The reduction in blood volume can cause lack of oxygen supply, hypotension and arrhythmia, and insufficient blood supply can cause dizziness, syncope, etc. The left ventricle has a large fat, the shrinkage force is strengthened, which significantly increases myocardial oxygen consumption, and further aggravates myocardial ischemia.',\n",
       " 'It is the most common cause of closure of the main pulse valve in my country and developing countries. Due to the flap fibrosis, thickening and shortened, affecting the edges of diastolic valve leaves. Simple aortic closure is not uncommon, often consistent with different degrees of stenosis due to the fusion of the valve junction, often combined with mitral valve damage.\\nIt is also a common cause, ranking second in Western developed countries. The infective bodies cause the petal leaf and the perforation, and the leaflets caused by the support of the structural damage and the abnormal bio to be closed, and the closure is caused to close. Even if the infection has been controlled, the flap fibrosis and contracture can continue. The progression of damage is different, which can be expressed as acute, subacute or chronic closure.\\nAortic aircraft loop expansion: It is currently a common cause of simply aortic valve in Western developed countries. The disease-understanding is characterized in that the aortic valve is substantially normal, the aortic sin-tube junction and the aortic valve ring are expanded, causing the aortic valve to the contrary or a large gap, resulting in the closure of the valve. Common causes include Ma Favish syndrome, idiopathic aorta dilatation or initiating aneurysm, lifting the main artery dissection, degenerative aorta expansion, syphilis, etc.\\n1 The incidence of two-leaf aortic valve is about 1% to 2% of the population, most of which can maintain normal valve functions to life. However, some cases can occur in the aortic valve closure, the aortic flap is stenosis or both. The case where the closed insufficient case is mainly the flap prolapse and the ambulance is closed, and the leaves are often thickened, and the flap can be curled, but there is generally no obvious calcification. 2 The high chamber interval defect or membrane chamber lack causes the aortic valve to bepassed and the apex is closed, followed by the aortic sinus tumor rupture accompanied by the prolapse of the corresponding valve.\\nAortic flap mucosa degeneration:\\nThe petal leaf is jealous. Occasionally merger, the central cystic necrosis of the aortic root, may be congenital reasons.\\nTreatment or medical sources:\\nClinical is relatively rare. The aortic valve caused by trauma is not more than a serious chest extrusion or impact injury. The pressure in the pleural cavity has increased, and the arterial pressure is increased, causing the leaflet tearing and the acute aortic closure is not complete.\\nOther reasons: ankylosic spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell aorticitis, etc. can cause the aortic valve closure.',\n",

In recent years, molecular taxation has confirmed that the genotype and expression of the two types of insect plants have obvious specificity. In 1993, the World Health Organization officially named Dispaneba Dispar in accordance with its obvious differences in its pendorizers, membrane antigens and virulence proteins and coding genes. The pathogenic insects are still referred to as Entamoeba Histolytica, so that most of the nourishes of the intestinal cavity are discontinabaszi, for intestinal ambient creatures, do not invade The intestinal wall, while the Nourishing body of the amba, regardless of its size, both invasive, can be swallowed with red blood cells, so this phagocyte or undeflocked red blood cells is called nourish Body, nourisher in patients with fresh mucus blood or liver abscess, active, 5μm / s, hyperplasia, and large morphological changes.\\nWhen it is tissue in symptoms, it is often intake of red blood cells, which is often 20 to 40 μm, or even 50 μm, but in the middle cavity non-diarrhee feces, the size is 10 ~ 30 μm, not included.

The encapsulation that is not killed after the stomach is promoted with bowel to the bowel, and the trypsin is spagged and escaped. It is parasitic in the colonal intestinal cavity, at which time the host becomes asymptomatic. If the infectious insects are invasive, small nourishers have invaded the intestinal wall tissue when the body is immunized, and turns a large nourisher, swallow the red blood cells and tissue cells, and damage the intestinal wall to form a lesion.

The death of death, the target cells die after 2 minutes. The adhesion of the nourishing body allows the target cells in the target cells to continue to increase significantly, which causes part of the cause of target cell death.

Release the outer toxins, destroy the gines, can cause LES tension and esophageal expansion (CHAGEAS disease), gastric cancer infringement of the muscular neural ginseng can also cause symptoms similar to this disease, some esophageal cardia lashes It often occurs, and has the degenerative changes of the vagus nerve and esophageal wall muscle layer, and some people think that the disease may be caused by neurotoxic viruses, but it has not been confirmed so far, although there have been literature reports, there is in the same family. Many people are suffering from the disease, and even the twin sons are suffering from the patient, but whether there is a genetic background in this disease, it is still unable to affirm it.\\nIt is believed that viral infections, toxins, nutrient lacks and local inflammation may be the cause of this disease, but in the electron microscopy of the vagus nerves and in the wall, the viral particles cannot be found, and the viral infection is not supported. Some children have a family history. Tip related to genes, clinical research found that mental concerns can increase the symptoms of children, considering whether psychotomy causes cortical neurological disorders, leading to the disease, in recent years, research found HLA DQW antigen and this disease Closely correlated and discovered an autotid body antagonized the gastrointestinal nerve in the serum of patients, suggesting that the nature has an autoimmune factor.\\nPathogeneous mechanism:\\nThe exact pathogenesis of cardia is still unclear, and its basic flaw is an abnormal neuromuscular, and the pathology is seen in the esophageal body and esophageal sphincter. There are different degrees of muscle neuropathy, and monocytes in Auerbach infiltrates The entire gangliocyte is replaced by fibrous tissue. The vagus nerve is Wallerian denaturation, and the neurodermal cell body in the back movement is normal. The esophageal smooth muscle is normal under the light microscope, but in the electron microscope, the microscope is refined and the cell shrinkage, but these The change is that the original or secondary is not clear. In summary, the results of histological, ultrastructure and pharmaceutical research have shown that the esophageal of the suspended transit is lost, the lesion is located in the brain dry, volatile nerve fiber, Auerbach Neuropine and muscle Inside nerve fibers, but cannot clarify where the original pathogenesis may be a diffuse neurodegenerative or to neurotoxic substances affect all neurological systems from brain to myostate.\\nThe pathophysiological mechanism of the cardia is as follows:\\n1. Neurotroporous lesions: patient esophageal ganglin (Auerbach glue) ganglion cells reduce, lack of degenerative, nerve fibrosis, no pathological changes suggest exogenous neuropathy, patient esophageal body and The muscles of the LES area have no response to the stimulation of the ganglift level, while the direct action of acetylcholine can cause contraction, and the patient's esophagus has strong reactivity to cholinergic, that is, strong segmental shrinkage, according to Cannon The law, that is, the tissue that loses independent nerves is more sensitive to the reaction of the neurophantants, indicating that the lesion is mainly in the nerve.\\n2. Inhibitory neuron is affected: LES district has two types of excitability (cholinergic) and inhibitory (nonicholine energy non-adrenerin NANC), vascular activated intestinal peptide (VIP) and nitric oxide (NO) It is NANC inhibitory neurotransmitter, mediated medlar, and NO ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, The reaction of patients LES's drugs such as opioids is different from ordinary people, and also suggests that there is an abnormality of nerve or myocyte receptors.\\n3. Valcular nerve function is abnormal: the patients with nature have obvious gastric acid secretion disorders, similar to the symptoms of vagus nerve resection, suggest that there is a degradation of nerve dysfunction.\\nIn summary, due to the vagulent hub and esophageal wall nerve disease, inhibit neurotransmitter, esophageal neurological atrophy and volatile neurological disorder caused LES resting to rose high; Les relaxation is not complete or completely unable to relax The esophageal body is not coordinated and the exercise is not coordinated. It has no driving effect on the food, so that the food is retained in the esophagion. When the esophageal internal pressure exceeds the LES pressure, due to gravity, a small amount of food can be slowly passed, long-term esophageal content residues, In recent years, the esophageal surgery is contracted after the treatment of LES obstruction in recent years, in recent years, in recent years, some patients have peristaltic contraction in the esophagus, but the non-political contraction of the esophageal body is not protected. It is related to LES obstruction.\\nThe relaxation slightly has tapped the entire chest esophagus, but not only limited to the cardia, the esophageal anatomy is normal, and it will be so thick, expanded, and lose normal peristalsis. After the cardians, the sterilization, and the normal blood movement is not possible. Relaxation, abnormality is mainly limited in the inner loop, and the outer longitudinal muscle function is normal, according to the extent of eclipoperatulatory cavity expansion, medium, weight 3 degrees,\\n1 Mildness: There is no obvious expansion or expansion of esophageal cavity, only the lower section of the esophageal, and the diameter of the general lumen is <4 cm, there is only a small amount of food and liquid retention, esophageal visible promoter contraction.\\n2 Moderate: The esophageal expansion is obvious, the diameter of the lumen is <6 cm, there are more food and liquid retention, and the esophageal is less promoter.\\n3 severe: Estrooplastity expansion, diameter of the cavity> 6cm, has a large amount of food and liquid retention, and the esophageal is not promoted.\",\n",

       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nHCV is a type of hepatitis virus, 1989 Chiron\\'s application molecular cloning technology in 1989, took the lead in succession (HCV) cDNA clone, HCV is the first human virus discovered by molecular biology technology, HCV belonging Virus section, its biological, gene structure and yellow virus, virus approximation 9.5 kB, the HCV genome has a large-encoded reading frame (ORF) encoding 3010 or 3011 amino acids, and the encoded multivariate protein and yellow virus have a significant common structure: structural protein (including core protein and envelope protein). ) And non-structural proteins (NS1-NS5).\\nHCV is RNA virus, which is more vary, and only 68.1% to 91.8% of nucleotides in different regions are the same. The difference in gene sequence according to HCV can be divided into different genotypes. At present, the HCV gene is not uniform, unified Method, okamoto divides HCV to four genotypes of I, II, III, IV, according to its classification, most North America, European HCV strain is Type I, Japan is mainly type II, and there are also type III and IV. According to Wang Yu report, the northern city is the main type II and III, and the city is 90% or more.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\n1. The direct pathogenic effect of HCV infection Many studies showed that the severity of HCV infection is related to its viral blood, and the severity of hepatic tissue of patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to the level of HCV RNA in hepatic cells than its serum. After the HCV RNA level is more dependent, after interferon treatment, the HCV RNA content is reduced with the serum, the level of Alt has gradually declined, and the above results suggest that HCV may have direct pathogenic effects, however, the immunohistochemical study Failed to fully prove that the expression of HCV antigen from liver disease was associated with liver disease inflammation, Groff et al. Found that the existence of HCV antigen in hepatocytes did not mean that HCV granules and liver disease activities were not necessarily to HCV antigen expression. Related to, and liver tissue inflammation is associated with the presence of HCV virus particles in hepatocytes, and it will also indicate that HCV has direct cellular pathogenic effects, and the direct pathogenic effect of HCV may be replicated with HCV in hepatocytes, causing hepatocyte structure and function changes. , Or interfere with hepatocyte protein synthesis causes hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis, and the presence of HCV asymptomatic carrying state seems to imply that HCV has no direct pathogenic effect, but recently report most of the ALT continues to normal \"chronic HCV carrier\" liver The organization has varying degrees of lesions and inflammation. The degree of inflammatory damage in liver tissue is related to HCV replication levels, indicating that there is less conditionless carrying state, and further supports HCV has direct pathogenic effects.\\n2. Cell-mediated immunological injury may be that the main cause of HCV caused by hepatitis C diseases is one of the important features of hepatitis C disease pathology. The gathering of lymphocyte concentration in the tube area, sometimes forming lymphoid filtering, compared to research considerations more Hepatitis is obvious, lymphocyte infiltration is undoubtedly related to the immune response, some scholars have proved that the lymphocytes in chronic hepatitis C will mainly CD8 + cells, many of which have active epitope, displayed as activation, electron microscope observed lymphatic The cells are closely contacted with hepatocytes, suggesting that it is increased toxic T cells in hepatocytes, and the cytotoxic T cells of chronic non-A-non-hepatitis B on autologous hepatitis C will increase, in chronic hepatitis C, cytotoxic effect Mainly caused by T cells, in contrast, immune effector cells are limited to non-T lymphocytes, chronic HBV infections, non-T-T lymphocytes are involved in hepatocyte injury, HCV specific antigen can activate CD8 + + And CD56 + cells, suggesting that CD56 + cells also play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C, patients with chronic hepatitis C patients can identify HCV\\'s C protein, E1 and E2 / NS1 proteins, which. The identification is limited by the HLA-I limit, and TC cells also have a role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C, and also studies have shown that most chronic HCV infected peripheral blood and liver tissue are restricted by HLA-II molecular weight. CD4 + cells (TH-1 cells) can attack HCV-specific immune antigen determinants, CD4 + cells respond to HCV core antigen related to liver inflammation, and TH-1 cells play a key role in chronic hepatitis, HCV specific The TH cell surface antigen determines the tuvation energy to reinforce the specific reaction of the HCV antigen, suggesting that TH cells can assist and enhance TC cell attack to destroy HCV infected hepatocytes.\\nE1, E2 / NS of HCV RNA is high variation, and it is prone to variation in vivo, and can result in a change in the target antigen (E1, E2 / NS protein) of HCV infection, and TC cells will be recognized again. The new antigen determinant, and attacks the damage to hepatocytes. This is the higher the HCV RNA variability, the more serious causes of its liver tissue inflammation, and also explain the immune-mediated mechanisms play an important role in hepatocyte injury of chronic HCV infection.\\n3. Autologous immune HCV infection is often accompanied by the following characteristics:\\n1 non-specific immune barriers, such as mixed condensation proteinmia, dry syndrome and thyroiditis.\\n2 non-specific autoantibodies can be detected in serum, such as rheumatoid factors, anti-nuclear antibodies, and anti-smooth muscle antibodies.\\n3 Part II autoimmune hepatitis [anti-HCV positive in anti-HCV \"male anti-HCV is positive.\\n4 anti-Gor;\\n5 Liver tissue changes similar to autoimmune liver disease, so people speculate that the pathogenesis of HCV infection may have autoimmune factors, but the relationship between anti-HCV, anti-LKM-1 and anti-GOR, and their disease Significance and the like have to be further studied.\\n4. Apoptosis of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C diseases is mediated by Fas antigens in the surface of the cell membrane, and Hiramats et al., Fas antigens are more common in HCV infection in normal liver tissues. Hepatic tissue with active lesions, especially around the door refuge, the expression of Fas antigen in HCV infection is closely related to the degree of inflammation of liver tissue and inflammation, and the expression of HCV core antigen in hepatocytes is closely related to the expression of FAS-mediated apoptosis is HCV. One of the forms of infecting hepatocyte death.\\nThe pathogenesis of HCV infection is complex, many factors and their interrelationships have to be further studied and elucidated.\\nCompared with other types of hepatitis, hepatitis C has its characteristic pathological changes, mainly the following:\\n1 lymphocyte agglomeration and Poulsen-Christoffersen cholangitis (gallbladder epithelial cell degeneration, surrounding lymphocyte infiltration) is an important characteristic, diagnosed value.\\n2 Early cases visible sinus inflatable cell infiltration, but the hepatocytes around the sinus are the important place to distinguish acute hepatitis B.\\n3 liver cell necrosis is lighter, the range is relatively limited, and it appears later.\\n4 Doux and hepatocyte gap fibrosis is more obvious than hepatitis B, and there is an earlier, which may be one of the reasons why it is more likely to develop into cirrhosis.\\n5 hepatocyte fat detriments are more common, and the fat vacuum can be large or small bubbles.\\n6 hepatocyte eosinophility becomes a sheet, and it appears in non-inflammatory reaction zone.',\n",

Press the problems of the disease can be divided into 2 categories\\n(1) Acute intestinal obstruction: stranded intestinal obstruction is generally acute intestinal obstruction, and it is also complete.\\n(2) Chronic intestinal obstruction: chronic intestinal obstruction is generally incomplete, and incomplete intestinal obstruction is generally simple intestinal obstruction, and chronic intestinal obstruction can also be acute.\\nPathogenesis\\nFrom simple intestinal obstruction to intestinal walls, necrosis, perforation, etc., a series of pathophysiological changes, mainly divided into the following three:\\n1 Three gases in the intestinal gas is three:\\n(1) from the gas (68%): Animal experimental intestinal obstruction, if the esophagus is blocked, then the intestinal tube above the obstruction is rarely gas, and it is clinically attracted to the gastric tube. The intestine is very small.\\n(2) From the digestion process, the food produced by bacterial decomposes.\\n(3) The gas from the blood is diffused into the intestinal cavity, especially nitrogen, the latter source accounts for 32% of all gas.\\nHibbard 1976 Reporting the Dog Test Intestinal Resistance to the gas ingredients in the intestinal cavity.\\nThe gas in the intestinal cavity, mainly N2, CO2, O2, can be balanced by the mucosa to penetrate the blood. The diffusion of N2 is very small, so the intestinal cavity is mainly N2. Methane (CH4) is produced by bacterial decomposition food. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can make the gastrointestinal decompression rubber tube into black. Some people think that H2S is a substance that causes intestinal obstruction, but Hibbard observes 600 ~ 800 ml of H2S saturated solution into the animal, and in 1936. Poison symptoms are not present.\\nThe liquid in the intestine is part from the moisture of intake, but most of the accumulated digestive fluid. The normal human digestive tract secreates with 8 ~ 10 L of the digestible liquid in 24 hours, except for 100 ~ 200ml of exclusions, most of which are absorbed into the blood, maintain the dynamic balance of body fluids. The electrolyte components of the digestive liquid in the intestinal tract are similar to the electrolyte components in the plasma (Fig. 1), so the loss of the intestinal fluid is equal to the loss of plasma.\\nAt low obstruction, there is less vomiting. Due to the intestinal expansion, the absorption function of the intestinal mucosa is reduced, although some electrolytes are absorbed, but the loss of actual water and electrolytes is still more obvious. At high obstruction, due to frequent vomiting, gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice is mainly. The loss of sodium ions is more than chlorine ions, so the opportunity of acid poisoning is more. In addition, the gastric juice and the intestinal fluid contain two times a plasma ion, and therefore it is often accompanied by the loss of potassium ions. In 400 cases in the North Medical University, 27.2% low sodium, 18.5% oligonians, 9.8% low potassium, and carbon dioxide binders accounted for 44.0%, higher than 29 mmol / L for 1.6%.\\nHaden and OrR described in 1923 to 1924, it describes that the introduction of brine can be built to cushion toxins. It is known that biomarium salt can supplement the loss of electrolytes, thereby prolonging the lives of patients.\\nWhen the obstruction progresses to a strand, the loss of blood can be generated. When most of the intestinal tubes have been stranded, there is no complete blood circulation interruption in the accumulated intestines at the beginning. When the small intestine is twisted, it first affects its intravenous reflux, resulting in congestion and congestion of the intestine. In addition to the small arterial spasm, intestinal force increase, further caused small blood vessel rupture, blood flow bet mucous membrane, and muscle layers, resulting in hemorrhagic infarction. At this time, the blood penetrates into the intestinal cavity and the peritoneal cavity, so blood is abdominal water can be produced. Until the mesenteric pressure is equal to the arterial pressure, the blood circulation is completely interrupted, causing intravascular coagulation. The amount of blood loss is shorter than the long-term proportion of the mesenteric bowel length.\\n2, the breeding of bacteria and an important change in the absorption obstruction of toxins, is excessive breeding in the intestine of the intestinal tube above the obstruction, mainly with Escherichiae and anaerobic bacteria. Breeding of bacteria can increase the opportunity of infection in surgery, especially with large intestinal obstruction. In addition, the toxins produced by bacteria are absorbed by the blood circulation and the lymph liquid, or the intestinal wall penetrates into the abdominal cavity, and the absorption of abdominal toxins occurs in the penetration. There is a large amount of oxygen and anaerobic bacteria in the intestinal tract, and the propagation of anaerobic bacteria after intestinal obstruction is accelerated. The number of bacteria in the intestinal changes changes simultaneously, for example, bacillus in the normal animal intestinal tube is usually located. In the large intestine, once the obstruction occurs. A large number of bacillus can also appear in small intestines. When stranging intestinal obstruction, due to the bleeding of the intestine facilitates the propagation of bacteria, there is a large amount of bacteria in the stranded bowel, and a large amount of toxins is often caused by death. BARNETT In animal experiments, the abdominal fluid of stranded intestinal obstruction can be injected into other animal abdominal cavities, which can die in animals. If a stranded intestinal is placed in a plastic bag that cannot be infiltrated, the mortality rate of the animal can be lowered. Yull 1962 discovered the same toxic substance in the abdominal fluid of human stranded intestinal obstruction. At the beginning of the strand, the intestinal wall has not changed, and the bacteria have not yet penetrated into the abdominal cavity, the patient's poisoning symptoms are not obvious. When necrotic, necrosis occurs, especially when the mesenter segment is long, the colorectal Escherichia, Streptococcus, etc., which have a peak, and the symptoms of toxicity are severe. Once the intestine is broken, the infection with shock is more serious, and it is dangerous to the patient's life.\\n3 Normal small intestinal pressure is from 0.267 to 0.533 kPa (2 ~ 4mmHg), and the intestinal pressure above obstruction can be raised to 1.33 kPa (10 mmHg) or more.\\nSimple low intestinal obstruction In the intestinal direction of intestines, the pressure can reach 2.67 ~ 4kPa (20 ~ 30 mmHg). When the intestinal distal obstruction, the colon is in charge. Because of 60% of patients, its retraction flap is good, so that colon is a closed, and thus its internal pressure can be as high as 2.5 cmH2O. Also because the intestinal intestinal wall is thin, and it is a concentrated point of the pressure reaction. Therefore, in this case, it is likely to perforated in this case.\\nThe increase in intestinal pressure causes the intestinal inflation while also increases intestinal peristalsis, and intestinal colic. The increase in intracarda increase can result in the paralysis of the intestinal muscles, the intestinal spheres are weakened, and the intraudinal sound is weakened.\\nThe increase in intestinal pressure will cause the venous reflux slowing. After 48 ~ 96h in the intestinal obstruction, it can be observed with a clear absorption and reduction in water, glucose, and strychnine, which can be transmitted during normal. Instead, lymphatic absorption has enhanced phenomena. Experiments have shown that in the intestinal tube of methicolate injection obstruction, it can be seen that there is a dye in the lymph nodes of the intestinal membrane; in the intestinal tube injection into the non-stable resistance, there is no dye in the same time. This may be due to the stagnation of the intestinal content, the venous pressure is high, and the lymph cycle accelerates, promotes absorption of such dyes.\\nIn addition, the above obstruction, intravenous venous reflux, intestinal edema, secreted water, sodium, potassium increase. 15cm a small bowel, can secrete 500 ml of liquid.\\nThe intestinal pressure is high for a long time, resulting in a change in intestinal fluidity. In 1935, Sperling and WANGENSTEN were used to close the intestinal obstruction experiment with dogs. When the intestinal pressure reaches the intraocular wall capillary internal pressure, it lasts for 10 h (2.0 kPa, or 15 mmHg), and the vitality and permeability of the intestinal wall have no significant change. After 28 hours, the viability is lost, and the permeability is enhanced. Recent deitch experiments found that simple intestinal obstruction is 6 h, bacteria can reach the intestinal lymph nodes, 24 hours can reach liver, spleen and blood flow. The authors believe that due to the obstacles of bacterial breeding and intestinal mucosa barriers. When the intractable internal pressure continues to increase, the intestinal wall pressure is equal to or greater than the intra-intestinal wall of the intra-artery, the intestinal wall is ischemic. If the obstruction cannot be relieved at this time, necrosis and perforation of the intestinal wall can be generated. Bacterial toxins in the intestinal cavity enters the abdominal cavity, producing severe infection poisoning as previously described, the most dangerous state of entering intestinal obstruction, often retreats the patient's life.\",\n",

If the intraoperative angiography and intraoperative biliary traveler are taken, the residual stone can be significantly reduced. The incidence; again, it is the original non-gratum, due to gallbladder removal postoperative ambiguity to form a stones; the other is due to the surgery, or the surgery is inevitable complications.\\nThe stenosis of the gallbladder is due to the failure of the malfunctional damage in the operation, and the symptoms have been discovered when the symptoms have, and the duodenal nipple hardening, stenosis and pancreatic tubing, stenosis, and pancreatitis. When the duodenum and gallbladder pipe cut, the metal probe has been forcibly passing the nipple, injuring oddi sphincter, and damage can also cause chondolact to be deposited from the end biliary mucosa and chronic inflammation.\\nThe incidence of PCS has no significant relationship with the following factors: gallbladder function displayed in oral gallbladder in combination; the size and number of stones in the gallbladder; non-gallstones, in recent years, the diagnosis of these diseases is due to the previous accuracy, so the diagnosis of these diseases Can get clear.\\nThe second type of PCS is a lot of PCS, and there is no reason. In recent years, it has been studied that the cholangi walls of PCS patients are particularly sensitive to the changes in the pressure. As long as they are injected into the gallbladder to injection into physiological saline, the biliary pressure increases and has severe pain. In patients with bile reflux before the cholecystectomy, there is a reflux after surgery, which may be related to Helicobacteroid function. In addition, the persistent pain of PCS may be related to psychological factors, and sometimes considering intestinal adhesion or gallbladder bed. Scar may.',\n",

It causes the epithelium to increase the epithelial hyperplasia.\\nIt has been reported that the incidence of cholasis cancer is 10 times higher than that of the general population. The age of cholangiocarcinous cancer patients with ulcer colitis is more than 20 to 30 years, with an average of 40 ~ 45 years old, often have a long time History of colitis, chronic bacteramia in patient portal vein systems may be caused by induced bile duct cancer and PSC, lesion, multiple waves, and ulcerative colonitis cause biliary cancer may be associated with chronic portal blood.\\n20% ~ 57% of patients with bile duct cancer accompanied gallstones, and thus the chronic stimulation of stones may be carcinogenic factors.\\nCongenital biliary cysts are prone to cancer have become a consensus, and the incidence of cholangiocyclic patients with congenital bile duct cysts is as high as 2.5% ~ 28%, and the cholangiocystic deformity has cancer than normal people. 20 to 30 years, although 75% bile duct cystic The malformation has symptoms in infancy and childhood, but in the event of bile duct cancer, 3/4 patients have symptoms of gallbladder cystic malformation in adulthood, and there is a mechanism of bile duct cystic malformation, some people think that pancreas When the opening of the bile duct is abnormal, the pancreatic fluid is reversed into the bile duct caused the bile duct epithelial, and other factors that may lead to malignant, stocked formation and chronic inflammation of the cystic chronic inflammation.\\nChinese branch test insecticom infection is also considered to have a certain connection with the occurrence of bile duct cancer, although the chondrospheres are mostly parasitic in the hepatic bile duct, but can also be parasitic in the liver bile duct, the worm itself and metabolites have long-term stimulation of bile duct mucosal epithelium Causes bile duct mucosa hyperplasia, producing tumor variations, cancer changes.\\nBile duct cancer can occur after years of surgery, can occur without stones, mainly chronic biliary tract infections caused by epithelial variation, often in biliary drainage.\\nRadioactive cerium oxide\\nAmong the patients with syntax of, the age of cholangiocarcinoma is 10 years earlier, and the average incubation period is 35 years (after contact with thorium), and there is more tip of the end of the hepatic bile duct tree.\\nNumerous cholangitis\\nThe opportunity of malignant norgeid cholangitis (PSC) patients suffering from tile cancer is also higher than that of ordinary population, and PSC is also related to ulcerative colitis.\\nB type and hepatitis B virus infection\\nRecent studies have found that hepatitis B, hepatitis C infection may be related to the occurrence of bile duct cancer, but the specific mechanism is still to be further studied.\\nK-Ras gene mutation\\nIn recent years, molecular biology has shown that the cholangiocarcinoma K-Ras gene 12 codon mutation rate reached 77.4%, indicating that the K-Ras gene mutation may have an important role in the occurrence of biliary tube cancer.\\nPathogenesis\\nBile duct cancer can occur in various parts of the hepatic bile duct, including the most common sections of the near-segment bile duct (liver door bile duct), accounting for 58%; the chollant of the COP segment accounts for 13% and 18% (Figure 1), which occurs in the gallbladder tube With 4%, 7% are filled.\\n1, pathological characteristics\\n(1) Classification of naked eye morphology\\nAccording to the general form of the tumor, bile duct cancer can be divided into four types of nipple, hardening, node and diffuse infiltration type, which is more common in infiltration type, followed by tangible type, and the nipple type is less. Cholangiocarcinoma is generally less formed, and most of the tube wall infiltration, thickening, tube cavity; cancer tissue is easy to tissue surrounding, often invading nerve and liver; patients often have evident and biliary infection.\\n1 papillary carcinoma: a large form of papillary gray white or pink fragile tissue, often in the tube, growing the surface of the surface, forming a sized nipple shape, arranged neat, cancer cells can have normal tissues, good Hair bile duct, which is easy to cause the bile duct, which is mainly infiltrated along the biliary mucosa, generally not to tissue, blood vessels, neuroblood gaps and liver tissue around the bile duct, and the surgical resection has high success rate and good prognosis.\\n2 hardened carcinoma: showing a gray-white cyclic hard knot, soaking the lower layer of the bile duct mucosa, thickening the bile duct wall, plenty of fibrous tissue, and forming a fibrous hard block to the pipe; accompanied by some bile duct completely occasion, lesion gallbladder Ulcers, chronic inflammation, and informal hyperplasia, like the gallbladder of the liver door, is the most common type in the cholangiocarcinoma of the liver door, hardened cancer cells are well differentiated, often distributed in a large number of fiber connective tissue, easy It is confused with scarification, fibrous tissue hyperplasia caused by hardening cholangitis, cholangi wall chronic inflammation, and sometimes even in the surgical tissue pathological sections, it is difficult to make correct diagnosis, and hardened cancer has obvious way to infiltrate up the bile tube wall. The tendency to tissue and liver substance to the bile duct, so that radical surgery often needs to be removed from hepatic leaves. Despite this, the surgery is often residual, and the true radical resection is not reached, and the prognosis is poor.\\n3 nodule type cancer: The mass forms a nodule of the bile duct, the nunisium base and the bile duct wall are continuous, and the inner surface of the bile duct is often irregular, the tumor is generally smaller, the substrate wide, the surface is irregular, this type Tumors are often infiltrated along the bile duct mucosa, and the tissue and vascular infiltration to the bile duct are less hardened, and the surgical resection rate is high, and the prognosis is better.\\n4 diffusely infiltrated cancer: less, about 7% of bile duct cancer, cancer tissue is widely infiltrated in the biliary pipe wall along the bile pipe, thickening, tube wall, lucine-changing, tube-wide connective tissue, difficult to determine The biliary part of the raw carcinoma, generally no surgery removal, and the prognosis.\\n(2) Organizational classification\\nMore than 95% of gallbladrous cancer is adenocarcinoma, a small number of squamous carcinoma, mucous cancer, cystic cancer, etc. Liver tube cancer, 30% ~ 32%; the branch of the liver tube is 20%; the gallbladder tube is 4%.\\nThe lack of unified classification of hepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which is commonly divided into 6 types according to the degree of differentiation and growth mode of cancer cells:\\n1 pillar adenocarcinoma; 2 highly divided adenocarcinoma; 3 octopurized adenocarcinoma; 4 undifferentiated cancer; 5 printed cell carcinoma; 6 squamous cell carcinoma and so on.\\nWith more adenocarcinoma, the division research report is inconsistent, but the most common histological type is still papillary adenocarcinoma, high-divided adenocarcinoma, accounting for more than 90%, a small number of adenocarcinoma and mucous adenocarcinoma There are also rare reports of rare gallbladder tube smooth muscle tumor.\\n2, transfer route\\nAbout 71.4% of the bile duct cancer has direct infiltration or metastasis, of which 33.3% wave and liver, 33.3% of the lymph nodes, 17.5% are peritoneal spreads, due to blood vessels, lymphatic networks and neural coupons around the bile duct, bile duct cancer cells By multi-channel along the bile duct to the liver or liver excess, retention, growth and reproduction, biliary metastasis, blood transfer, nerve metastasis, infiltration, etc. The liver door biliary cell carcinoma cells can be diffused and spread to the intrahepatic direction and the duodenal ligament in the liver direction and the duodenal ligament, but less occurred in the liver direction and the duodenal ligament.\\n(1) lymphatic metastasis\\nIt is more common, often transferred to the liver door and the pancreas peri-die, less lymphatic metastasis, and the above-segment cholangiocarvertless lymph node metastasis is high, and the biliary tube is in the intracellular vein, the branch of the hepatic artery is covered into the Glisson sheath, Among them, there is a rich neural fiber and lymph, Glisson sheath is delayed to the liver duodenal intestinal ligament, and there is a richer neural fiber, lymphatic, lymph nodes and loose connective tissue, and the bile duct itself has a rich mucous membrane and lymphatic. Pipe network, in recent years, with the development of high bile duct cancer resection, the lymphatic junction of the liver door has attached great importance to the anatomy of 27 patients lymph nodes of liver door, proves that there is a lymph node, and the coarse drainage lymph is present after the hepatogenic ditch rear gate veins. The tube is accompanied by portal veins and there is a coarse lymphatic tube between gallbladder lymph nodes and gallbladder lymph nodes and hepatic artery lymph nodes.\\nThe lymph transfer is the most common transfer path of bile duct cancer, and it may happen very early. It is reported that only pathological inspections are limited to early cholangiocarcinoma in the mucosa, and the lymph node metastasis of regional lymph nodes, and the lymphatic node group of biliary tube cancer is:\\n1 gallbladder tube lymph node; 2 lymph nodes around the gallbladder; 3 small reticular hole lymph nodes; 4 pancreatic twelve lyphosis; 5 lymph nodes; 5 pancreatic twelve lymphatic; 6 portal lymph nodes; 7 abdominal arterial lymph nodes; 8 liver solid artery lymph nodes; before the hepatitis, the lymph nodes; ⑩ ⑩ 系 上 上 淋 淋 淋 淋 淋 为 为 为 为 为 为 为 部 部 部 部 部 部 部 部 部 部 部 部 部 部 部 部4 groups of lymph nodes.\\nOverall, the lymph node metastasis of the liver door bile duct cancer is mainly along the hepatic artery pathway; the medium-section bile duct cancer lymph node metastasis metastases, in addition to infringing the lymph node, the mortal membrane and the aortic lymph node; distant bile duct cancer, The transferred lymphoid is limited to around the top.\\n(2) Invaving metastasis\\nMore common, cholangiocarcinoma cells are in the upper and surroundings of biliary tube walls and the main characteristics of cholangiocarcinous carcinoma, the upper choline carcinoma infiltrates the liver of adjacent bile ducts, and the central cholangiol carcinoma has arteries and portable arteries, and the lower bile duct cancer The pancreatic infiltration, cancer cells are more diffuse infiltration growth in the bile duct wall, and coexist with the bile duct and surrounding connective tissue, making the gallbladder carcinoma infiltration range, which is difficult to determine the scope of the resection in the operation, in addition, the result of direct infiltration It also leads to important adjacent structures around the bile duct, such as large blood vessels, liver invasion, so that the surgical resection is limited and difficult to achieve radical resection, and cancer tissue residue is one of the main reasons for postoperative recurrence, liver metastasis is the upper part. The main transfer method of bile duct cancer is less common.\\n(3) Blood transfer\\nCan reach the whole body, the most common is 10% to 25%, pathological studies have shown that the bile duct cancer specimens and surrounding discovery of 58.3% ~ 77.5%, indicating that the violation of the blood vessel is a common biology of bile duct cancer cells. Phenomenon, biliary cancer tumor vessel density is significantly correlated with the incidence of cancer swelling, and with the increase in tumor vascular density, the incidence of metastasis is also increased, and it is suggested that tumor angiogenesis plays an important role in infiltration and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma. Observing the transfer of lymphatic systems often occur in terms of cholangiocarchers, in fact, tumor angiogenesis and vascular violations are closely related to lymphatic metastasis. Therefore, during the infiltration and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma, tumor angiogenesis and vascular violations are basic links.\\n(4) spread along the neurons\\nThe incidence of nerve invasives can reach 33.3% ~ 83.4%, so it is clinically jaundice and pain as a hypermanence, and the vagus nerve and sympathetic nerve domain in the liver duodenity is constituted in front of the liver duodenal toughness. The cluster has a complete gap, a continuous gap, called a neural surrounding gap, in which the neural surrounding gap is an integral part of the lymphatic system, but later passed the light microscope and electron microscopy, nerve The surrounding gap is an independent system, no relationship with the lymphatic system, tumor cells can transfer to proximal or distal direction through the gap in the neuroprosis, statistical indication, the neuropenes around the inverse cancer cell infiltration and liver and liver duodenal ligament Tissue metastasis is clearly related, suggesting that certain cases of liver, liver duodenal ligament and surrounding connective tissue may be achieved by diffusion of neural surrounding gap cancer cells, and therefore, the gap infiltration of the neurogenic surrounding gap should be prognosis. Key factor.\\n3, clinical pathological staging of bile duct cancer\\nAt present, it is an important reference for measuring the condition and determination of treatment strategy and evaluation of TNM in clinical practice.\\nBiSMUTH-CORLETTE divides the liver door bile duct cancer into the following type 5 according to the part of the lesion, and is now widely used at home and abroad:\\nType I: Tumor is located in the liver general, unobstructed;\\nType II: Tumor is located in the left and right liver tube convergence, unreasonable left, right liver tube;\\nType III: Tumors are located in the bile duct of the convergence and violated the right liver tube (IIIA) or violation the left hepatic tube (IIIB);\\nIV: Tumor has violated the left and right bilateral liver tubes.\\nOn this basis, domestic scholars also divided IV to IVA and IVB.',\n",

High voltage zone, the rest of the pressure is 2.0 ~ 4.0 kPa (15 ~ 30mmHg), which constitutes a pressure barrier, and prevents the physiological effects of the stomach content to reflow into the esophagus, normal human intra-intra-pressure increase can cause LES by volatile nerves Contract reflection, enabling LES compression to prevent ger, LES pressurized and abdominal pressure, can cause ger, studies to show that Lesd <0.8kpa, is easy to happen Flow, about 17% ~ 39% of the Germanye GER associated with this, cholinergic and β-adrenergic material, alpha-adrenergic antagonistic, multi-kidney, stability, calcium Receptor antagonists, morphine and fat, alcohol, caffeine and smoking can affect LES function, induce Ger, in addition, pregnancy, oral progesterone contraception period and menstrual cycle, plasma progesterone level Increased, the incidence of Ger is also increased accordingly.\\nNormal esophageal layer cleaning features include esophageal emptying and saliva and two parts. When acidic stomach contents are reflux, only 1 to 2 times (about 10 ~ 15 seconds) esophageal contingent is inseparable, almost All anti-fluids remain in the esophageal mucosal trap in the esophageal mucosa, which can be saliva (normal person is from 1000 ~ 1500ml, the pH is 6 ~ 8 saliva, the stomach, the stomach, and the esophageal layer The function is to reduce the time limit of the esophageal mucosa soaking in the gastric acid, so there is a role in preventing anti-enterprises, and the study found that most esophageal emptying abnormal hair is early from esophagitis, and the reduction of saliva is reduced and esophageal is rare. At night, the saliva secretion is almost stopped, and the esophageal secondary peristalsis is rare, and the esophageal acidity is clearly delayed at night. Therefore, the harm of GER in the night is more serious.\\nThe barrier function of esophageal mucosa resistance is composed of the following factors: 1 epithelial factor including the HCO-3 concentration of the mucous layer, the surface of the mucosa; 2 epithelial factors include the connection structure of epithelial cell membrane and cells, and epithelial transport, intracellular buffer , Cell metabolism and other functions; 3 post-epithelial factors refer to tissue-based basic acid state and blood supply, when the above-mentioned defense barrier is damaged, even in normal reflux, it can also happen, study find, esophageal epipium epithelium The weakness of cell proliferation and repair capacity is one of the important reasons for reflux esophagitis.\\n1, the gastric emptying is abnormal: the incidence of gastric emptying delays in patients with reflux esophagitis is more than 40%, but the causal relationship between the two is still arguing.\\n2, gastric duodenal reflux: under normal circumstances, esophageal squamous epithelial cells have a cornerstone surface, which prevents H + from penetrating into the mucosa to protect the esophageal mucosal surface to be affected by acidic antiflows, and when Helicobacteroids When the LES is pressed, the hydrochloric acid and gastric protease in the gastric juice, the cholic acid, pancreatic juice and lysulfuric lecithin in the duodenal liquid can be simultaneously reverse flow into the esophagus, erod the alopecies of the epithelial cells of the esophagus, and change it Thin or falling off, H + and gastric protease in the reverse fluid deeper into esophageal tissue through new squamous epithelial cells, causing esophagitis.\\nIt is common to slide hernia, and the esophageal gastric joints enter the chest, the rising of the gastric body is separated, the cracked hole is expanded, the sachet is hidden, with the body position, force and cough, and the hump is increased. It is no longer sliding, and the normal anatomical relationship near the cleavage is changed. It has caused the esophageal gastric joints to close, the sputum into the gastric hi angle disappears, and the tube film is elongated, thin, thin, abdomen, the venofeng, The closing function of the joint portion is further deteriorated, and half of the patients in the patients of the cracked pad occurs.\\nSurgery to disturb the normal anatomy of esophageal splitting and affect the function of esophageal gastric joints can occur after surgery, such as vagus nerve cutting, esophageal diachelism, gastric resection, etc., long-term The stomach tube can cause the cardia to be completely closed to cause esophagitis, but the cause can be recovered after the cause is released.\\nPregnancy vomiting: Crack splic hernia due to increased intraperitoneal pressure in pregnancy can cause reflux esophagitis, but can be restored after childbirth, no need for any treatment, vomiting and long-term hiccup can also make the cardou mouth frequently open anti-current esophageal Inflammation, removing the cause can return to normal.\\nOther diseases: newborns and infants in the development process, due to the adverse fluid function of the esophageal, with early child development, most of them can be reduced, there is still a primary esophageal, and there is a non-closedness of the microscopic function. Equivalent diseases such as esophagus and tumors in tumors, hard skin diseases, and all kinds of pyloric obstruction can cause reflux esophagitis.\\nTherefore, reflux esophagitis is usually the result of reflux bile and gastric acid to act on the esophageal mucosa, and must first exist in pylons and LES functional disorders before bile causing esophageal injury; reflux esophagitis more gastritis Sliding esophageal cracked tartarin is easy to malfunction in the disorders of LES and HT function; duodenal ulcers are more volatility, which is easy to have high stomach and Helicobacter, so there are also many diseases. Obesity, a large amount of abdominal water, post-pregnancy, high-pressure increase in gastric pressure can induce this disease.\\nPathogenesis\\nNormal physiological condition When the tube esophagus enters the gastrointestinal sac to the right side, the HIS angle is called the angle, and the gastropi is pushed to the esophagus to actively prevent the reflux of the gastroesophageal, and the mucosa in the entrance of the gastrointestinal esophageal The high pressure area under the esophagically is also an important factor in preventing reflux. These normal anatomical relations have played the role of preventing gastroesophageal reflux, destroying the prevention of gastroesophageal reflux mechanisms, and the gastrointestinal joints will result in frequent Reflow.\\nThe opinion of the gastroesophageal reflux is generally considered that the gastrointestinal reflux patients are low, and the intake tube sections are short or disappeared in the abdominal esophageal section. The esophageal cavity is expanded and the change in the reflux is the increase in the tension of the tube membrane, which is often pulled by the distal end of the esophageal. At that time, for example, there were more fat in the tube film in the obese patient, reducing the length of the venom vesicle, the heavy smoke and drinkingers had non-specific esophagitis, which enable the tube membrane and the far end esophageous. The length of the abdomen esophagus is reduced, and the above assumptions involve an abnormality of the tube film.\\nReverse current is physiologically physiologically, if it is dysfunction, it is pathological, esophageal epithelials are exposed to reflux of gastric acid, which is the cause of esophageal, and the esophageal mucosa and gastric acid contact continue to decide. The frequency and each reflux continuous time, and is determined by the esophagus for acid removal, the pH of the esophagus is continuously monitored by 24h, and its normal value is 5.0 ~ 6.8, the pH is below 4.0 is considered to be a reflux, Because pH 1.8 ~ 3.8 is the upper limit of protease optimal activity, during straightness and awake state, because of gravity clearance and swallowing action, the neutralization of alkaline saliva, normal human reflux does not cause damage, frequent reflux Especially in supine and deep sleep, esophageal has no activity, although the reflux is less, it is slow, there is no gravity help to remove, and there is no sputum of saliva, so the incidence of reflux esophagitis is high, anti-fluid In addition to food, the gastric juice contains acid, protease and mucus, adding biliary salt, pancreatic enzymes are extremely sensitive to esophageal mucosa, can have an esophageal or esophageal function change, or both, comprehensive factors, reflux Promotes the occurrence of esophagitis.\\nAfter the healing of chronic reflux patients, the ulcer mucosa, the neonatal epithelium is replaced by esophageal gastric joint, and the upper column epithelial epithelium is present in the upper column epithelium in the cardia, and the Barrett esophagus or columnar epidemic is known.

       " \"It is estimated that there are 280 million HBSAG-positive infections around the world, and my country accounts for about 10 million, of which 2/3 is asymptomatic carrier, due to high HBV infection, through different transmission routes easy to overlap infection with other hepatitis viruses, Frequently with the following:\\n(1) HBV and HAV double infection\\n1. At the same time, infection: This type is less, due to the first infection of HBV, HAV, its clinical manifestations and liver function examination are significantly infected, in addition to the proliferation of a few patients, most of the most acute jaundice hepatitis, good prognosis , No symptoms and liver damage aggravation.\\n2, overlapping infection: Different domestic reports, the overlapping rate of HBV and HAV is 0 ~ 23.4% in acute hepatitis, from 1988 Shanghai Hepatitis A epidemic, about 10% for HBSAG chronic carrier overlapping infection HAV, it can be seen that HBsAg is highly carried out, and there is an epidemic of hepatitis A, HBV and HAV overlapping infections are also more common.\\n(2) HBV and HCV double infection\\nSince HBV has a high carry rate, its overlapping infection has a large chance, foreign report HBV and HCV overlap infection rates are 15% to 28%, 1990 domestic report HBSAG positive, anti-HBC IGM negative chronic activity Hepatitis 40, with ORTHO C100-3 diagnosis of pills detection anti-HcV positive rate is 17.5%, and the results are basically the same as abroad.\\n(3) HBV and HDV double infection\\nDomestic reports have different HDV infection rates from 0 to 12%, and the regional differences are also large. In 1989, Zhang Yongyuan reported 16 provinces and cities, more than 200,000 liver tissue specimens of HDAG test results, its positive rate is 5.33% ~ 19.77%. Although the HDV infection and HBV infection are close, the HDV infection rate is not consistent, and the HBV infection rate is high in the region, and the HDV infection rate is also high in terms of tanhanhanitis. However, Among my country and Southeast Asia, HBV carry rate is very high, but the HDV infection rate is very low, and the reason is to be further clarified.\\n(4) HBV and HEV double infection\\nHepatitis perfusion can be popular in the world, and there is an outbreak of outbreaks around the world. Therefore, HBV and HEV overlapping infection cannot be ignored, and the simple HEV infection is mostly manifested as a self-limiting process, and the prognosis is good, however, for pregnant women It can lead to uneven hepatic failure, high mortality, and Indian reports Most heavy hepatitis have overlapping HEVs for HBSAG carriers, and therefore, in areas, HBV and HEV overlap infections may cause severe hepatitis.\\n(5) HBV and HCV, HDV multiple infections\\nThree or more or more hepatitis virus have less infection, the development of the condition is clearly related to the degree of liver disease before the overlapping infection, such as the symptomatic HBsAg carrier appears as the symptom, the liver function is abnormal, and if the original is chronic activity Hepatitis or cirrhosis, the performance of clinical symptoms and obvious liver dysfunction, the treatment of weight, my country's heavy hepatitis is mainly HBV and HCV, HDV overlap infection, the liver is serious, the prognosis is poor, due to the application of blood transfusion and blood products Treatment of chronic liver disease and heavy hepatitis is very common, and in my country's HBsAg is high, up to 10% ~ 15%, blood donor is high-hcv positive rate is also high, so that HCV infection has also, heavy glutage is also It can overlap HAV, but there is no significant effect on its condition and prognosis.\",\n",

       " 'There are many causes of cirrhosis, and the main causes of different regions are also different. my country is mainly based on viral hepatitis B, Europe and the United States is more common in chronic alcohol, common causes: 1. Viral hepatitis, mainly B Type, tanhanitis virus infection; 2. Chronic alcoholism, male 40g / d, female 20g / d> 5 years, or nearly 2 weeks> 80g / d; 3. Non-alcoholic fatty hepatitis (NASH); 4. Bile siltation; 5. Hepatic intravenous reflux is blocked;\\nRefers to viral hepatitis development to the later formation of cirrhosis. It is known that hepatitis A, B, C, Ding, and glutinous types are known. In recent years, the study of hepatitis A and pentane hepatitis, except for severe severe diseases, do not form Hepatic cirrhosis, B, and hepatitis B are easily converted to chronic, chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis.\\nIn 1974, Shikatu reported that HBSAG (hepatitis B surface antigen) was shown in the microscope, which contained HBsAg in a microscope, which was dyed with HBSAG-containing hepatocyte pulp. Orange red, after years of preserved cirrhosis specimens, use this method can also be shown to contain HBSAG liver cells, which makes the hepatitis B virus have a reliable basis, and 10% ~ 20% of hepatitis B patients are chronic. Long-term HBsAg positive, liver function intermittent or continuous abnormalities, hepatitis B virus continuously replicates in intrahepatic virus to infiltrate lymphocytes in the hepatic cells, release a large number of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, to remove viruses while removing the virus, necrosis, lesions If the continuous development of repeated continues, the fiber can be formed in the liver small leaves, and the regeneration nodules form cirrhosis, 68% of hepatitis C is chronic process, 30% chronic hepatitis C isochemical into cirrhosis, but-type hepatitis and B Hepatitis is simultaneously infected or overlapping infection, can slow down the replication of hepatitis B virus, but often exacerbate the activity of lesions and accelerates the occurrence of cirrhosis.\\nAcute hypermasty, hepatocytes, bulk necrosis of viral hepatitis, expand from the center of the small leaflet to the tube area, causing the mesh bracket collapse, close closer, forming the fiber separation, and produces the bridge phenomenon of the small leaf center to the tube area, but forming large Hepatic cirrhosis formed by node cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, has obvious inflammation and fibrosis in the tube area, forming a wide irregular \"active\" fiber separation, stretching between small leaves and small leaves, making adjacent Each leaflet is separated and destroyed by the fiber, and although the liver structure is modified, it is not cirrhosis, but the hepatic fibrosis stage, when the inflammation is expanded to the center of the liver leaflet, causing a spray-like necrotic and monocytes The infiltration, the fiber segment also continues to expand to the center, divide the liver leaflets, add hepatocyte regeneration, forming the regeneration nodule wrapped by the connective tissue, and becomes cirrhosis, the end of the disease, inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis can completely disappear However, there is only a nodule in the fiber segment, the nodule is multi-small leaf, forming a large biolability cirrhosis, such as hepatitis lesions, slowness, can also form small tonel cirrhosis , Mixed hepatic hardening or regenerative nodules are not obviously cirrhosis (incomplete separation cirrhosis).\\nFrom viral hepatitis development as cirrhosis, it is said that it has nothing to do with the infection antigenic quantity, and there is a significant relationship with viral toxicity and human body immunity, and genetic factors are related to human leukocyte antigen HL-A1, HL-A8. Lack of similar relationships, but still to study further.\\nThe incidence of alcoholic cirrhosis in Western countries is caused by alcoholism. In recent years, the incidence of food in my country has increased, and the incidence of fatty liver and alcoholic cirrhosis has also increased. According to statistics, the occurrence of liver hardening and the amount of drinking and time is short. Although drinking alcohol 80g daily can cause rising serum valley propaminase, sustained a large amount of drinking, a few months to several months can occur fatty liver or alcoholic hepatitis, if you continue to drink more than 15 years, 75% can occur in cirrhosis .\\nAfter alcohol enters hepatocytes, it is converted to acetaldehyde under the action of ethanol dehydrogenase and microblica ethanol, and the acetaldehyde is converted to acetic acid, and the acetic acid is transformed into a reduced coenzyme I (NADH). Thus, NAD decreases, NADH increases, then the ratio is lowered, and the tricarboxylic acid circulation in mitochondria is inhibited. The esterification of fatty acids increases, and triglyceride increases, and the liver is reduced, and there is too much in the hepatic NADH. The synthesis of fatty acids is also promoted, so that the power of fatty fatty acids causes excessive hepatic triacourgists, exceeding the treatment capacity of the liver, and fatty liver, long-term drinking, can make the hepatocytes further change, necrosis and follow-up In inflammation, alcoholic hepatitis is used in fatty liver, and there is a wide variety of hepatocytes under microscope and a multi-shaped nuclear white cells and monocytes containing alcoholic transparent hyalin tubing regions. Fiber tissue hyperplasia, finally forming small tape-resistant cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis leafy center veins can cause fibrosis and tubular transparent-like necrosis caused fibrosis and tubular cavity, exacerbated portal vein high pressure, central unit fibrosis expanded to peripherals, also The \"Bridge\" in the charter area can be formed.\\nSuch as sorghum or hepatoma, etc., in the gate system, the insectica eggs are deposited in the liver, causing the diameter of the portal venous small branch plug, and the insect ovulation is larger than the diameter of the branch of liver small leaves, so the embolism causes inflammation in the tube area , Granuloma and fiber tissue hyperplasia, enlargement of the tube area, destroying the liver leaflet board, the hepatocyte of the lobular edge, the hepatocyte regeneration nodules are not obvious, may be related to the venous branch of the venous eggs, and the liver cell nutrition is related, because The portal vein is blocked, the gate hypertension is obvious, there is a significant esophageal varicose vein and spleen, the adult causing cellular immune response and secretion of toxins are caused by intrahepatic granuloma, and the eggs cause body fluid immune response, produce antigen-antibody complex It is possible that the cause of inflammation and fibrosis in the hepatic gone branch and its surroundings, parasitic liver hardening is not significant in morphological regeneration nodules.\\nChemical substances can be divided into two categories: one is direct toxic to the liver, such as carbon tetrachloride, methotrexate, etc .; the other is indirect toxicity of the liver, such poisons are independent of the drug, Patients with specific qualities first causing allergic reactions, then cause liver damage, minor patients can cause cirrhosis, such as diporal acyl, isoproniazid, fluoroalkane, and their lesions are similar to hepatic cirrhosis after hepatitis, carbon tetrachloride Direct toxicity of the liver, the damage of the liver is proportional to the size of the drug, causing the abused fat infiltration of the liver and the necrosis of the liver, carbon tetrachloride itself is not toxic substance, through a drug metabolic enzyme, such as P-450 Micropartile enzyme system removes carbon tetrachloride to a chlorine atom, which forms trichloromethane, ie chloroform, which becomes a drug metabolic enzyme system of hepatocytes and microsomes (producing trichloromethyl free radicals). And chlorine-free), causing lipid peroxidation and hepatocyte damage of hepatocyte biofilm, due to the damage of micro-structures in hepatocytes, reducing the metabolism of carbon tetrachloride, thereby weakening The liver continues to damage, after recovery, the liver function can return to normal, and only the large nodeic cirrhosis occurs only in the carbon tetrachloride repeated or long-term exposure.\\nAnimal test was repeated to carbon tetrachloride carbon, allowing the drug accumulation to cause cirrhosis.\\nAminikatrexate is an anti-folic acid drug. It is often used to treat leukemia, lymphoma, psoriasis (psoriasis), etc., it can be reported to cause small tonel cirrhosis.\\nPrimary Biliary Cirrhosis Causes and pathogenesis may not be clear, may be related to autoimmunity, secondary biliary cirrhosis is caused by cholangi obstruction of various reasons, including stone, tumor, benign narrow narrow And the external pressure of various reasons and congenital, after tomorrow, the bile duct occurs, more benign diseases, because malignant tumors die before the patient cirrhosis.\\nThe complete bile duct obstruction caused by various reasons can form cirrhosis in 3 to 12 months, and the incidence is about 10% of these patients.\\nThe early stage of bile duct obstruction, but the bile color is dark, but it can become white, due to bile siltation and bile duct expansion, the pressure on the bile duct is increased, inhibits the bile secretion, the bile can become white by green, form a so-called \"white bile\", microscope The small bile duct high expansion of the tube area, even the bile duct, bile overflow causes necrosis and inflammation in the tube area and the liver leaf peripheral area, necrotic stove is filled with bile duct, forming \"gallbladder\", this is mechanically bile duct obstruction One feature, the lesion continues to progress, the necrotic and inflammatory stimulation of the circumference of the tube area increases the fiber tissue of the tube area, and extends to the small impellation, the fibers of each of the sets of pipeline are connected to each other, and the liver leaves are divided, which is incomplete Separal cirrhosis, the center of hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, is different, but the disease may continue to develop, and the fiber segment of the tube area to the small leaflet center area can also occur in the late stage. And there is a characteristic manifestation, so that there may be no difference in different liver hardening and other liver in pathological forms and other liver hardening.\\nThe principle of bile duct obstruction can form liver sclerosis may be due to the expanded bile ducting and bile oozing, and the fibrous tissue extends to the bile duct, and the fibrous tissue is released from the liver cells, and finally the cirrhosis is formed. Incomplete cholangi obstruction rarely develops biliary cirrhosis.\\nIt is known that the bile duct infection is not necessary to form a cirrhosis. According to reports, there is more common bile duct obstruction of non-infected, and the biliary liver sclerosis is more common.\\nDue to the chronic congestive heart failure caused by various heart disease, narrow-neutral stericitis, etc., so that the liver is in a congestion and hypoxia state, and finally forms cirrhosis, and the budd-chiari syndrome is due to hepatic vein chronic obstruction growth period liver. Cirrhosis is also identical to cardiogenicity.\\nWhen the cardiac is increasing, the blood perfusion in the liver is low in the hepatic peripheral, and the angiogenic oxygen in the liver leaflet is high. When the flow of liver leaves, the oxygen content is reduced, and the heart function is not fully present. Central intravenous pressure Increase, central vein and its surrounding liver sinus expansion, congestion, compression hepatocytes, hepatocyte degeneration, shrinking, or even bleeding, hypoxia and necrosis can stimulate the plastic hyperplasia, fibrosis, and even central intravenous hardening fibrosis, gradually The center is extended to the surrounding, and the cellulose of adjacent leaflets is coupled to each other, that is, the center-to-center fiber separation, and less infringement is relatively infringed, which is the characteristics of circulating obstacles, and continues to progress due to portal fibrosis After liver quality, it is constantly regenerated and bile duct regeneration, and finally lost congestional hepatic hardening. This type of cirrhosis is small nodules or incompletely separated cirrhosis in pathological form.\\nMalnutritional Cirrhosis has long believed that malnutrition can cause cirrhosis, but it has been lacking direct evidence. Animal experiment gives lack of protein, choline and vitamin diet can result in changes in cirrhosis, but the lesion is reversible. And the lack of blood vessels in vascular, and some authors have observed the patients with malignant malignant malnutrition, and found that their liver damage is fatty liver, and there is no cirrhosis, only children occasionally the liver is filled. Sexual fiber proliferation, like liver hardened Affiliate, mostly believe that nutritional disorders reduce the resistance of other pathogenic factors, such as chronic specific or non-specific enteritis, except for digestion, absorption and malnutrition, pathogen generated by the pathogen in the intestine to enter the liver, the liver cannot Clear it, and cause hepatocyte denaturation necrosis to form cirrhosis, so the malnutrition is the indirect cause of cirrhosis, and the cirrhosis caused by the small intestine bypass surgery, some people think that due to malnutrition, lack of basic amino acid or Vitamin E, in the diet, the saccharons and proteins are unbalanced and absorbed from the food to absorb a large amount of toxic peptide and caused by poisonous butchols with liver.\\n1, congenital enzyme lack: anti-ɑ1-anti-antitrypsin deficiency, ATɑ1-AT), ɑ1-AT is a glycoprotein, is the main component of ɑ1 globulin, this disease is a commonly stained hereditary disease , Normal human serum 1-AT is 2.3mg / ml, patients only (0.2 ~ 0.4) mg / ml, ɑ1-AT lack caused the cause of cirrhosis, it is speculated that ɑ1-AT is toxic to hepatocytes, or make The hepatocytes have decreased to the toxicity to the toxicity, and the liver disease is changed to the large nodulation or small tonel cirrhosis, in the crude surface of the hepatocyte (1-AT) has a glycoprotein deposition, hepatocytes PAS staining positive inclusion body, meaningful for diagnosis.\\nCongenital 1-Phosphate-Uridyl-Transferase deficiency is a rare disease that causes semi-lactal hymmosis, and there is a common baby after birth, and the liver has Severe fat infiltration and active regeneration phenomenon can form large biovascular cirrhosis and ascites and metallic hypertension, the pathogenesis is unclear, which may be associated with 1-phosphate in the liver.\\nGlyco Storage Disease can occur in small nodules of cirrhosis, especially the type III, which is related to the lack of starch-1,6-glycosyl enzyme.\\n2, metabolic obstacle cirrhosis: Hepato-lenticular degeneration, also known as Wilson disease, is a cirrhosis and brain degenerative disease caused by common-stained recessive copper metabolism, due to a large amount of copper salt Deposited in the liver causes damage to liver tissue, the liver is usually reduced, the texture is hard, and is a large nodular cirrhosis.\\nHemochromatosis: For a halt of the metabolic disease, the common-stained recessive genetic disease, there is iron metabolism disorder on the basis of gene abnormalities, and the iron, the iron, the iron, pancreas, heart, kidney, Spleen, skin, etc. cause cellular damage, fibrous tissue hyperplasia and organ damage, showing skin pigmentation, diabetes and cirrhosis.\\n3. Hemorrhagic TeLangiectasia: Type-stained dominant genetic disease, part of cirrhosis, and can be seen in the fiber segment of the liver. Very large expansion of thin-walled capillaries.\\nPancreatic fibrocystic dissease is abnormal, which can cause liver fat infiltration, abnormal mucus blocking pancreatic tubes, causing bile duct obstruction, forming biliary cirrhosis, and there are also congenital syphilis can also cause liver hardening.',\n",

after oral gallbladder profile, the gallbladder is well developed, the liver activity tissue is not abnormal.\\n(2) Dabin-johnson syndrome: The cause of jaundice is that non-combined bilirubin is converted to binding bilirubin in hepatocytes, combined with bilirubin, and is obstacted to capillary bile ductility, this disease is characterized Serum blended bilirubin increased; the gallbladder is not developed after oral gallbladder condenser; the appearance of the liver is green black (observed under the laparoscopy), the liver biopsy can be seen that there is a diffuse brown pigment particles in the liver cells, and the prognosis is good.\\n(3) Rotor syndrome: The cause of jaundice is that hepatocyte intake non-binding bilirubin and binding bilirubin to capillary bile duct, this disease is characterized by serum non-combined and binding biliary Increase; indigo green (ICG) excretion test obstacle (decrease); most of the gallbladder angiography is well developed, only a few non-developing; the liver-free particles are sinking, the liver activity tissue is normal, and the prognosis of the disease is generally good.\\n(4) Crigler-Najjar syndrome: The cause of jaundice is the lack of glucuronic acid transferase in hepatocyte microparticles, so that non-binding bilirubin can not be converted to binding bilirubin, this syndrome can be divided into heavy or light, former Because of the high concentration of non-bilirubinin in the blood, it has strong affinity with fat tissue in brain tissue, so it is prone to biliary brain disease (nuclear jaundice), more than newborn, its prognosis is very poor, more after birth Death within 1 year; the latter lack of glucuronic acid transfer enzyme is lacking inside the liver cell microsomes, so the symptoms are lighter, and the prognosis is slightly longer.\\nPathogenesis\\nNormal bilirubin metabolism\\n(1) Sources and formation of bilirubin: 80% ~ 85% bilirubin from the hemoglobin of ripe red blood cells, normal red blood cells have an average of 120 days, from hemoglobin released from aging and damaged red blood cells by monoconuclear - Macrophage system (spleen, liver, bone marrow) swallowing, destroying and decomposition, becoming heme, iron and bead protein under the action of tissue protease (iron is reused, beads into protein mesh), hematarin is blood red The effect of vegetarianase is transformed into chloride, and the chlorophyll reductase is reduced to bilirubin, and the normal people have about 60 ~ 80g / L from red blood cell destruction, resulting in bilirubin. The total amount is about 340 ~ 510 μmol / L, with an average of 425 μmol / L; in addition, 15% to 20% of bilirubin derived from hemoglobin (invalid hematopoietic blood) in the bone marrow, and hepatocyteenin, Blood-containing protein (including myoglobin, hydrogen peroxidase, peroxidase, cytochrome P450, etc.) Rurgene (also including bypass bilirus) is called unconjugated bilirubin; non-binding bilirubin is rapidly combined with serum albumin to form a non-binding bilirubin-containing composite, and then Blood circulation is transported to the liver, non-binding bilirubin is not soluble in water, can not be filtered from glomerular pellets, so the uric acid does not contain non-blended bilirubin, but non-binding bilirubin is soluble, good with adipose tissue The affinity.\\n(2) The intake of the liver on non-binding bilirubin:\\n1 The liver is ingestion of non-combined bilirubin: the liver is an important place for bilirubin metabolism. When transported by blood to hepatocytes by blood, non-combined bilirubin After the albumin is separated, that is, the micro-hepatocyte DISS\\'s gap is taken by hepatocytes, after entering hepatocytes, non-binding bilirubin is carried (Y and Z protein as the special protein Y and Z) of hepatocyte pulp (Y and Z protein as Carrier), transported to the microparticles of the liver cells.\\n2 binding of non-binding bilirubin (i.e., the formation of bilirubinin): there is a glucoqueous transferase in the microparticles of the slide, non-binding bilirubin is combined with glucocyanic acid under the effect of the enzyme. A glucuronic acid ester is formed, or conjugated bilirubin, combined with binding bilirubin, binding bilirubinin I (monoester), combined with 2 molecule glucogenes. Combined with bilirubin II (hypoglactin), most of the blended bilirubin, which is blended from the bile, is a bilirubin, which is water-soluble due to bilirubin, and can be filtered through the glomerular mesh. Experimentally tested from urine in urine, urinary diachelin qualitative test positive.\\n3 Combined with biliary excretion: How to discharge from hepatocytes after blending bilirubin, its exact mechanism has not fully clarified, and it is considered to be completed by active excretion, combined with bilirubin is transported to capillary Bile tube, micro-tube, fine tube, small bile duct, liver tube, gallbladder tube, duoden into the duodenum.\\n4 gallulent liver circulation: combined with bilirubin is discharged into the intestines and cannot be absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, and after the end of the intestinal end and the colon is reduced to uricine (daily intestines) The total urine choleiosidia is about 68 ~ 473μmol. Most of the urine choles is oxidized to urinary bothermine from the feces, also known as feces (or feces); small partial urinaryity ( 10% ~ 20%) is absorbed by the ileum and colon mucosa, and the venous blood flow is returned to the liver. In the urine of the heate, most of them have changed to bilirubin, and there is a combination of bilirubin. As a bile is discharged into the intestines, this process is called \"bilirubin\\'s pig liver circulation\", with a small portion of failure to transform into bilirubin, but the body cycle (ie small some urine → liver vein → The following vena cava → Heart → body circulation), exogenous from the kidneys, normal people are generally no more than 6.8 μmol from urine, and urinary urogemia tests are weakly positive or positive.\\n2. Hemolysis jaundice\\nAfter a large amount of red blood cells destroy (hemolytic), the non-binding bilirubin is increased, and a large number of non-binding bilirubin is transported to the liver, which will inevitably increase the burden on the liver (hepatocytes), and more than the intake of non-combined bilirubin When the combined ability, the non-binding bilirubin concentration in the blood is increased, in addition, anemia caused by a large amount of hemolysis is in a state in which hepatocytes are in hypoxia, ischemic, and the ability to intract, combined with non-combined bilirubin is inevitable. It will be further reduced, resulting in a more increased jaundice in the blood concentration in the blood.\\n3. Hepatobic jaundice\\nSince the hepatocytes have undergone widespread damage (denaturation, necrosis), hepatocytes have an obstacle to non-binding bilirubin, and the concentration of non-blended bilirubin in serum is increased, and some uneven liver cells are still It can continue to take up, combined with non-binding bilirubin, which transforms into binding bilirubin, but part of the blended bilirubin is not allowed to be subjected to capillary tubes, but the necrotic hepatocyte gap is reversed into the hepatic lymphic solution and In the blood, or due to hepatocyte degeneration, swelling, tubing area inflammatory lesions and capillary bile duct formation, the excretion of binding bilirubin is blocked, resulting in binding bilirubin via a small bile pipe overflow (in the small bile duct Crossing increases and breaks) and reflows into the liver lymphosis and blood, which ultimately leads to the binding bilirubin concentration in serum to increase jaundice.\\n4. Blocking jaundice (bile premium jaundice\\n) Whether it is capillary bile duct, fine bile duct, small bile duct, or an hepatic blood and bile duct, total liver tube, gallbladder and proliferation pots, etc., occlusal or bile premium, blocking or depth top bile duct The internal pressure is increasing, the bile duct is expanding, and it will ultimately lead to the culvert, and the capillary bile duct is broken, so that binding bilirubin spills from cracked bile duct, reverse flow into the blood, there are sort of hepatic Ball biliary premium is not completely caused by mechanical factors such as bile duct rupture (such as bile preferences caused by drugs), but also due to the reduction in bile reduction (secretion dysfunction), the permeability of capillary bile duct increases, bile concentration, and staggered flow Reduce, ultimately leading to the deposition of the biliary tube and the formation of bile biline.',\n",

Most diverticulosis is caused by the reasons for the day after tomorrow. The histological studies have not found that the colon wall muscle layer has an anomalies, and the incidence of diverticulum increases with age. It also provides strong evidence to this, which is rare.\\n(1) Factors affecting the formation of diverticulum: One is the tension of the colon wall, the second is the pressure difference of colon cavity and abdominal cavity, and the internal pressure of any part can be determined by Laplace pressure, LAPLACE pressure (P = KT / R, P is the intestinal pressure, T is the intestinal wall tension, R is a colore radius, k is a constant): The intacular pressure and intestinal wall tension is proportional to the intestinal wall radius, which has been carried out. When continuous segmentation movement, the colon can produce a very high cavity in particular, the maximum cavity in the colon is located in the colon and ethyl colon, which is sufficient to cause the mucosa to protrude the colon muscles to form a diverticulum.\\n(2) Structure characteristics of the colon wall may also be a factor in the disease. The collagen fibers in the colon cyclic muscle are interspersed, allowing the colon wall to keep tension, increase the inclusions of the colitis, the colonal cells Thin, the elastic protein fiber is weakened, the elasticity and tension of the colon wall are lowered, so the narrow, the most hypertrophic colon is the good part of the diverticulum, the muscles of the colon belt are in a contracted state, so it is not easy to have a diverticulum, which has been confirmed, diverticulum patient Ethylene colon smooth muscle bundle is compared with normal human hypertrophy, even without forming a smooth muscle muscle bundle, abnormal smooth muscle bundle is also a manifestation of the prior diverticulum, is not limited to the sidelic colon, can also be expressed in colon Other parts, such as the rectum, this is more obvious after the ethyl colon removal, and the weaknesses of the colonies have been shown in the early stage of the disease, in addition, the connective tissue disorder caused by structural proteins is also in the early days of diverticulum disease.

Since the drug resistance to the drug is used alone in the human body, the drug resistance to the drug is obtained, that is, the drug resistance, the drug resistant bacteria can cause treatment, affecting the efficacy, the long-term contact of the tuberculosis Dependence, that is, the so-called drug resistance, but Lami is very rare in clinical practice.\\nThere are two sources of peritoneal lesions:\\n1. Active lesions such as intestinal tuberculosis, mesenteric lymph nodding or pelvic tuberculosis, spread directly to peritoneum.\\n2. Blood-infected millet tuberculosis and tuberculosis can be discontinued by blood circulation to the peritoneal abdominal; the blood discomfort caused by the primary syndrome of the lungs can form a potential lesion in the peritoneal, and tuberculous peritonitis can occur when the body resistance is low.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nAccording to the main pathological changes of the peritoneal, it is divided into exudate, adhesive and cheese.\\n1. Over-perioplastic abdominal cavity is slurry fibrino exudate, grass yellow, occasionally bloody, dirty and lasminate thickening, congestion, edema, adhesive fibrino exudate, yellow or grayish white The small tubular nucleus of the millet sample is not equal, and there is also a grouped plaque.\\n2. Adhesive peritoneal obvious thickening, there is a small amount of slurry fibrino exudate, a large number of fibrin deposition and fibrous tissue proliferation makes the intestinal film, the intestinal lymph nodes in the intestinal interpolation, forming a block, resulting in a chronic intestine Obstruction, large reticulum thickening, harder, severe abdominal cavity completely occluded.\\n3. Cheese-type is mainly used as peritoneal cheese-like necrotic lesions, intestinal, large reticular, mesenteric or abdominal organs, bonding each other into multiple housing, accumulating a small amount of turbid purulent exudate, housing can be intestinal , The vaginal or abdominal wall is broken to form an inner fistula or feces, more common in advanced patients, and the peeled unestaline lymph node can form tuberculous abscess.\\nAccording to statistical analysis, the adhesive is most common, followed by exudation type, cheese-type, and in the development of the disease, there are two types or three types, called \"mixed\".',\n",
       " 'Surgery (30%):\\nTrauma, anesthesia and surgery, especially the abdominal cavity, pelvic surgery and vagus nerve cutoff, can directly stimulate the body or visceral nerve, causing the autonomic dysfunction of the stomach, reflective inhibition of the gastric wall, causing gastric smooth muscle relaxation, which in turn forms expansion. Attachment, tracheal intubation, postoperative oxygen and stomach tube, can also entert a large amount of gas into the stomach and form expansion.\\nDisease state (30%):\\nThe twelve colonal tumors, duodenal tumors, foreign matter, etc., which can cause gastric twisters, and duodenal tumors, foreign matter, etc., can cause gastric retention and acute stomach expansion. The lesions near the pylorph, such as spinal deformity, cyclic pancreas, opaque, etc., the output path of the stomach, which causes acute gastric expansion. Cast Syndrome (Cast Syndrome) caused by gypsum set 1 to 2 days, may be excessive spinal stretch, duodenus is subject to the intestinal morta compression. Emotion, mental depression, malnutrition can cause plant neurological disorders, and reduce the tension of the stomach and emptying delay. Diabetic neuropathy, anti-alkali drug applications, water, electrolyte metabolism disorders, severe infections (such as sepsis) can affect the tension of the stomach and the emptiness of the stomach, leading to acute gastric expansion.\\nStress state (10%) generated by various trauma:\\nEspecially the upper abdomen is contused or severely injured, and it has a strong stimulation with the abdominal neurality.\\nExcessive eating too much in a short period of time is the reason.',\n",

       " \"The internal organs caused by various reasons, insufficient intestinal membrane blood vessels can result in intestinal ischemic damage, the intestinal mucosa has the most sensual sensibility of ischemia, and the rats have observed rats in the occurrence of blood loss shock, its small intestinal mucosa Combining self-solving is.\\nThe principle of treatment ischemic damage should be to restore blood reperfusion as soon as possible, but the long-term ischemia will reperfusion injury after restoring the perfusion, which is due to calcium Overload, oxygen free radical generation, neutral granulocytes are activated by the release of various enzymes in elastase and collagenase, and endothelial cell steady state imbalance.\\nThe intestinal is the largest bacteria in the human body. Since the protective effect of the intestinal mucosa itself causes bacteria and toxin to invade, this protective effect is called the defensive barrier, shock, intestinal ischemia, suffocation, artificial feeding, etc. can result in intestines The breakage of the barrier is then caused by the imbalance of bacterial micro-ecology and the invasion of bacteria and toxins to induce AHNE.\\nThere is no exact understanding of AHNE pathogenic pathogens, but from the patient's feces, anaerobic bacteria, Escherichiae, specific Krethia, clossed spore or gasulum bacteria can be separated from the patient's feces.

Under normal conditions, intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, intercellular joints constitute a mechanical barrier, and intestinal mucus and mucin form the intestinal mucosa The surface of the elastin layer makes bacteria cannot invade and protect chemical and mechanical stimulation. Under normal conditions, the secreted immunoglobulin (SIGA) of intestinal mucosa is extremely important, which is extremely important for immune barriers. The role is to make the mucosa surface form a protective layer, preventing bacterial adhesion, causing bacterial aggregation, inhibiting bacterial activity, and bacterial toxins and resists virus, lack of multi-protein hydrolase, SiGA lack, bacteria adhesion to mucosal epithelium and form a colony Furthermore, bacteria and endotoxin are invasive and lymphoid system invasive circulation, forming intestinal endotoxemia and bacterial translation (BT).\\nThe pathogenesis of AHNE has focuses on the research on inflammatory mediators in recent years, injury, enstinal endotoxemia and bacterial translational chain reactions of cytokines and inflammatory mediators under certain conditions. Platelet activation factor (PAF), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and endothelin 1 (ET-1) may be an important inflammation that causes its morbidity Sexual media.\\nAlthough there are many reasons for explaining the occurrence of the disease, some cases do not have these susceptible factors, and there is a material confirmed that AHNE is associated with viral infection and pregnant women can be addicted. Because the cardine is alpha-adrenal energy effect, The blood flow of the uterus can be reduced, increasing the contraction of the fetal mesenteric blood vessels, thereby causing the fetus hypoxia, a series of changes.\\nThe disease is more infringed on the lower or ileum of ileum.

That is, for acute gangraneous cholecystitis, the necrosis of the gallbladder wall can occur, resulting in biliary peritonitis, gallbladder perforated part occurs in the gallbladder bottom or stones embedded gallbladder bow or neck, such as gallbladder to adjacent organs Such as duodenum, colon and stomach, etc., can cause courage, at which time acute inflammation within the gallbladder can be drained by the inner fistula, the inflammation can disappear quickly, the symptoms are relieved, such as the gallbladder The gallbladder tube can cause acute cholangitis, and a few people can also have acute pancreatitis. Most of the pathogenesis is E. coli, Krebacles, and the inner bacteria, anaerobic bacteria accounted for 10 ~ 15%, but sometimes up to 45%.\\nAcute non-gallstones, gallbladder tubes often have no blocking, most patients have unclear, often occur in some abdominal surgery that have nothing to do with the courage, sometimes in some abdominal surgery, usually in some non-hemolytic anemia, general It is believed that the application of dehydration, fasting, anesthetic analgesic after trauma, and the effects of neuroendocrine caused by severe stress reactions, resulting in lower gallbladder contraction function, bile retention and gallbladder mucosa resistance decline, here On the basis of bacterial infection, finally causes acute inflammation of gallbladder, and believes that some cases are caused by acute embolization of nutritional blood vessels in the gallbladder. The pathological evolution of such acute non-gallstones is similar, but the disease development Quick, generally developed gangrenful gallblaysia within 24 hours, and manifesting the neutrality of the whole gallbladder.\",\n",
       " 'Congenital development of intestines, one of the common causes of intestinal obstruction in neonatal.\\nCauses\\n1. Embryonic period intestinal cavitation\\nIn the past, according to Tandier, it was considered that the digestive lumen had a complete bowel tube covered by epithelial cells before the fifth week of embryo development. Since then, the epithelial cell growth is extremely fast, and the intestinal cavity is blocked due to the proliferation of epithelial cells, and it is called the substantive period. There is a vacuum in the middle, forming a cystage gap and each other, and the intestinal cavity is re-penetrating during the embryo 12 weeks, and if the gap is incomplete, it is formed to form a latch or narrow. In recent years, some questions have been proposed, such as Tandler learning, such as type III small intestine or colon lock.\\n2. Fetal intestinal membrane blood circulation is obstacles due to damage\\nEnteric vessel branch deformity or occlusion, fetal intraperitoneal infection, such as fetal immectitis, can cause colon lock and narrow. Louw et al. Conducted a study of colon to lock in the colon. They won the blood vessels of a small intestine membrane of fetus, which can cause this small intestine locked, and this small intestinal membrane also has a defect, and the gastrointestinal lock is proposed due to the obstruction of intestinal membranes during embryos, may be intestinal Torsion, adverse intestinal rotation, inner hernia or vascular malformation.\\nAbram et al. (1968) use 80 days of sheep tires to tighten the petric intestinal membrane, almost 100% can cause I, II or III intestinal lock, so the colon lock and narrow embryo development can be in the above situation. Any one exists.\\nPathogenesis\\n1. Pathology: pathological and small trains are similar, depending on the level and morphology of the latch, can be 3:\\nThe type I diaphragm is closed: the intracx, the diaphragm is separated from the distalmost side, and the two parts are inciscatched with each other; or a small hole in the center of the separator is connected to form a colon stenosis.\\nType II strip-shaped latch: intestinal intestinal film, intestinal tube, proximal end is connected by fiber cables.\\nIII intestinal defect: far, proximal end is the blind end of separation. There are V-shaped defects in the mesener.\\nThe intestinal locked and stenosis of the cross-colonity occurred in the holy, and the intestinal locked and stenosis of the spleen and the stenosis occurred in I and II.\\nThe latching proximal intensity is significantly expanded, the hypertrophy, the peristaltic function is poor, the distal intestine is harvested, narrowed, changing, and there is a white hard mucus substance in the intestinal cavity. If the blind flap is complete and the lock is far from the colon liver song, it is blind, and the blind intestinal height of the back blind pet and the latch is highly expanded, the intestinal wall is thin, ischemic, necrosis and even perforation. Since a part of the intestinal locked and stenosis occurs in advanced pregnancy, about 10% to 20% of the colon is latched, the child can be discharged soon.\\n2.

Clostridium difficile is an important cause of pseudo-membrane, in 1935, from Hall, etc., the elongated strict anaerobic Gram-positive, separated from the baby's feces. Bacillus, this bacterium is in the intestinal tract of the in vivo, in patients who do not receive antibiotic treatment, the number of difficult restrictions only accounts for only 2% to 3% of anaerobic bacteria, and the bacteria is produced. There is less toxins, and even do not produce toxins that are pathogenic to the human body. The detection rate of the stroke Bacillus in the population is 5% ~ 13%, and these bacteria are constrained in normal cases, and they cannot breed a lot of disease, and they will not lead to disease. Long-term use of a large number of antibiotics can inhibit the growth of various bacteria in the intestine, the drug resistance is difficult to distinguish between the drug resistance of antibiotics, rapidly reproduction, and the stasis of the stretch bits can high up to 10% of anaerobacteria. ~ 20%, producing a large number of extracts, causing mucosa necrosis, exudative inflammation with fake film formation, almost this elimination can be found in all fake membrane enteritis.\\nIt is difficult to distinguish between at least four substances, i.e., toxin A (intestinal toxin), toxin B (cytotoxin), motion effect, and a thermally sensitive toxin, wherein toxins A and B have been purified.\\nThe molecular weight of toxins A is 500,000, and the molecular weight of toxin B is 360,000, which are consisting of glycoproteins, sensitive to acid, alkali, ether, and heat resistant, most of the 30 min of toxins at 50 ° C, mostly destroyed, Phasel, glutamotoxidase and cellular protease sensitive, not decomposed by ribonuclease and deoxyribonucleic acid enzyme, under pH 4 or pH 10 conditions, toxicity disappearing with toxin B is not affected.\\nToxin A can stimulate mucosal epithelial cells to increase the secretion of water and electrolytes, so that moisture and electrolyte are lost, toxin B can cause local metamorphosis, cellulosic denature necrosis, cellulose, mucin exudation forming a fake film, such as this toxin Injecting into the animal can cause enteritis, lethal, toxin A can stimulate the activated glycoside cycoside cyclogenase in the low concentration, resulting in an increase in the increase in intracellular G-phosphate sputum nucleoside, toxin A and toxin B function Synerg, first toxins A causes intestinal tissue lesions, and then toxin B is again acting on these damaged tissue cells. There are antigenicity of the two toxins, and the antibody acts, toxin A anti-precision cannot neutralize toxin B. And the antiseric clearance of toxins B can be neutralized and partially toxin A, in addition, toxin B can be neutralized by the Supoxica antitin.\\nThe third toxin moving influence factor exists in the filtration and sterilization of the bracicobacillus culture solution, which can change the rabbit back intestinal pythromiography, the fourth toxin is a low molecular weight protein, sensitive to thermal sensitive It is very unstable, its role is the same as cholera, the intestinal toxoids of Escherichia coli can cause increase in the secretion of rabbits, but does not cause tissue damage.\\n2. S. S. S. aureus is used in a large amount of broad-spectrum, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, pionex matrix, etc., inhibits E. coli after using a large amount of broad-spectrum antibiotics (such as oxytomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, pionex). Various flora, drug-resistant gold-yellow staphylococcus aura, resulting in the occurrence of extracts, leading to the occurrence of pseudoscopy, makes the stools of such patients can find a pile of Sococcus, such as Pseudomonal enteritis can also occur in the animal injection of bacteria, some people report that 17% of the golden Staphylococcus aureus is tested in the stool in a group of admission patients, and the anti-pharmaceutical treatment is 1 week after treatment. Golden grape The detection rate of Sococcus is 38% to 40%.\\nIt is also believed that in fake membrane enteritis, the golden staphylococci is only a companion. It is not a real pathogenic factor, and some people have tissue or cultivate fake membrane enteric autopsy materials or stool. Staphylococcus, also reported that antibiotic-related pseudo-film enteritis patients have golden staphylococcus aureus and their toxins, without seeing the aforementioned difficult to distinguish bacillus and toxins, which can be seen that it has been confirmed The bumperis of the bumper is an antibiotic-associated fake membrane enteritis is an important cause, but not all fake membrane enteritis is caused by difficult to distinguish between bacillus.\\nNormally, the gastrointestinal tract is a balanced ecosystem. There is a large number of bacteria in the intestines. These bacterial strains and quantities are basically constant, these bacteria helps the bacteria itself and the antibody produced by the human body to resist Infection, once some factors make this system lose ecological balance, it will cause disease, antibiotics is most likely to produce the proportion of flora, therefore is one of the important causes of pseudo-membrane, theoretically, any antibiotics can cause this disease. . The most common is the application of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially Lin Kemycin, ampicillin, ampicillin hydroxyxipicycin, and third-generation cephalosporin, inhibiting the normal flora in the intestine, making it difficult to distinguish Bacillus spore bacterium can be quickly propagated and caused by toxins. This case has also occurred after surgery, especially after gastrointestinal cancer surgery, and other serious diseases such as intestinal obstruction, malignant tumors, uremia, diabetes, heart failure, sepsis, and accepted kidney transplant patients treated by him. patient. These cases generally resistance and immunity are extremely low, or anti-antibiotics due to conditional needs, changes in the body, and intestinal flora disorders are conducive to difficult to distinguish bacillus breeding.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nTesting mechanism\\nThe bacteria in the intestine come from the oral cavity, and the bacteria that enter the digestive tract from the outside is killed by stomach acid. Only a few bacteria that have not been killed into the twelve colon and the upper section of the ileum, the duodenum and Survive bacteria is mainly Gram-positive Streptococcus, lactobacillus, particulate spuri and yeast, total number of less than 105 / ml, the number of bacterial numbers in the middle and lower stage of the ileum start, the content is estimated to be 105 ~ 106 / ml, in the lyrics After the end section, the intestinal content of Escherichia is mainly, the intestinal content takes into the large intestine, and the bacteria are neutral or weakly alkaline in the hypoxic environment, and the contents are multi-breeding under the conditions of moving slowly, the main thing is The number of anaerobic opportunities, the number of anaerobic bacteria can be about 1011 in each milliliter, and the normal human intestines are mainly anaerobic bacteria, and only 1% is only 1% of the degree of oxygen.\\nThe normal flora in the digestive tract is regularly distributed according to the plantation, and the breeding edge is excreted outside. The result is constant for life, my country's results of healthy people's fecal flora are similar to the bacteria and sequence of foreign countries, suggesting enteric flora Anaerobic bacteria is main, the number of menu of 9 common bacteria is: Bacillus, Bifidobacterium, Schobacillus, Enterobacter, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, yeast, normal human intestinal bacteria The split period is 6 ~ 48h, and the gastric acid in the stomach and jejuno mucosa also have intrinsic inhibition characteristics in the stomach and jejuno mucosa, and the stomach and small intestines of patients with gastric acid or part of the patients with gastric acid or partial stomach. It has been found that the number of oxygen and anaerobic bacteria has increased significantly, and E. coli and anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli have appeared in recent small intestines, and Streptococcus, lactobacillus and fungi have also increased.\\nNormal flora promotes the digestion and absorption of body nutrients, participate in the body's cholesterol, steroid, fat, protein, lipid, amino acid, and the absorption and metabolism of certain drugs.\\nThe intestinal flora is a non-specific immunity by the following mechanisms: 1H2O2 effect; 2 bacterial toxin effect; 3 placeholder protection effect; 4 organic acid effect; 5 compete for nutrients, normal flora can also produce a variety of antigen materials Stimulating the immune response of the body, allowing the immune system to actively defense in a variety of infections, intestinal flora disorders, such as bacteria reduction will cause lymphatic tissue development, low proliferation capacity, white blood cell decrease, decreased globulin content, etc. The secretion capacity of lymph factors will also affect the cellular immune response, the establishment of delayed metamorphosis, one of the main physiological effects of E. coli is its immunogenicity, E. coli can produce trace toxins like other normal flora, as An immunogen causes an immune effect on toxins.\\nThe intestinal flora composition is affected by physiological factors such as enzymes, mucus, antibody secretion, and function such as enzymes, mucus, antibody secretion and function, and changes in the interaction, food, drugs, climate, age changes. .\\nNormal bowels are the main defense mechanism that prevents bacteria in small intestines, the small intestines rely on strong peristaltic effects far in the intestinal cavity, when the intestinal peristalsis is reduced, the small intestinal bacteria will intensively grow, gastric acid kills the small intestine The bacteria makes the slurry of the part, once the gastric acid is reduced, and the amount of oxygen and anaerobic bacteria in the stomach and the small intestine will increase significantly, and E. coli and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria in recent segment, while fungi and The number of Streptococcus also increases accordingly.\\nUnder normal circumstances, bacteria in the human intestine interdependence, mutual constraints to form a natural ecological equilibrium between bacteria and the human body, and bacteria in the intestine are basically balanced in strains and quantities, and the contents of the large intestine The substance contains 1010 to 1011, and the small intestine also contains 108. In normal ecological equilibrium, these bacteria cause the antibody generated by bacteria itself and bacteria to resist the invasion of pathogens, bacteria do not constitute Hazards and can also synthesize certain vitamins, a large number of antibiotics, especially orally for the balance relationship between intestinal bacteria, will appear in the intestinal bacteria of the intestinal bacteria, non-pathogenic bacteria, such as large intestine Bacillus, etc., due to sensitivity of antibiotics, relatively strong bacteria, such as Golden Staphylococcus, Pseudomonasia, certain capsular spurs and fungi, etc., secreted extracts cause intestinal lesions The immunity of the patient's body and disease resistance function or certain diseases lead to intestinal ischemia, congestion, etc. can result in pseudoscopic enteritis.\\nPseudo-membrane must have a disorder of intestinal strains, endogenous or exogenous refractory stretch bits or Goldenogus Staphylococcus aureus and the above bacteria to produce toxins and susceptible body.\\nIn infants and young children are difficult to distinguish between the intestinal normal flora, because the toxin receptors on neonatal and baby mucosa may not be mature, it is not difficult to cause disease, it is difficult to cause The stroke bumper can account for more than 50% of the total bacteria, 30% to 90% of the infant guts within 1 year old, carrying this bacteria in the intestines, and then gradually decreases with age, to an intestinal tract to the adult period. 3% of bacteria.\\nAfter the patient uses antibiotics, the intestinal flora is killed or inhibited, causing disorders in normal flora, although it is difficult to distinguish the strobacterium, but it is still proliferated in the case of a bacterial decrease in antagonism. The patient is not a bacteria before accepting antibiotic treatment. In the intestinal needle and anaerobic bacteria in the intestine, the intestinal planting resistance drops, causing the bacterial receptor on the intestinal mucosa cells occupied by these bacteria. Bacillus from the outside world is attached.\\nIn addition to the application of antibiotics, other diseases that do not use antibiotic treatment, such as stomach-cutting or vagus nerve resection plus pylorial formation, gastric resection gastrocal gastrointestinal effect, duodenal or empty vertex, surgical blind袢 (end-side anastomosis), intestinal obstruction (stenosis, adhesion, inflammation, cancer) intestinal short circuit and crash affect, low-gastrive and accompanying movement dysfunction, intestinal fistula, back blind part, etc. can cause gastrointestinal The change in motion function, the change in the intestinal environment, such as the backpoint of resection of the resection of the lost back to the blind petals in the normal distribution of the intestinal flora, can not prevent the colon alternating colon from flowing into the small intestine, weakened the intestinal pair Excessive antibacterial defense capabilities of transprises in flora, other leukemia, malignant tumors or accelerated radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, infection, chronic consumable diseases can also change the ecological balance of intestinal normal flora, feces may also be separated into difficult Treatment of pseudoscopy of pseudogenic enteritis.\\n2.

However, since individual differences are large, there is also a study that the dose effect relationship between drinking and liver damage is not very clear.\\nThere are many alcoholic beverages, and different alcoholic beverages have differentiated damage to the liver. Drinking is also a risk factor for alcoholic liver injury, and fasting drinking is more likely to cause liver damage than meals.

       " 'The pathogenesis of acute appendicitis is not yet, but most opinions believe that several factors have occurred, and the recognized factors have the following types:\\nThe appendix is \\u200b\\u200ba long pipeline, only one end is connected to the blind, once the obstruction, can accumulate in the lumen, increase the internal pressure, and the oppression appendix is \\u200b\\u200bhindered by distal blood, in which the intra-lumen is invaded in this basis. , Easy to infect, some people have found almost all obstruction, common obstruction from: 1 blockage, dilatation, food debris, foreign matter, mites, etc. The control cavity is narrow or adhesion; 3 appendectogenic membrane is too short to form appendective distortion, hinder the pipeline; lymphatic tissue hyperplasia or edema causes a narrow in the appendicent; 5 appendix is \\u200b\\u200bin the vicinity of the appendix, Such as inflammation, polyps, tuberculosis, tumor, etc., the appendective opening is pressed, blocked, and the manure stone obstruction is most common, accounting for 1/3.\\nThe obstruction is a basic factor in acute appendicitis. Therefore, there are often swords and umbilical cramps in the early stage of acute appendicitis. This is the symptoms caused by appendectinous lumen, increased internal pressure. In addition, the specimen of the appendix is \\u200b\\u200boften visible. Durestulum obstruction cavity, distal obvious inflammation and even gangree perforation.\\nThere are also obstructive and the cases, the main factors are the direct infection caused by bacteria in the appendicent, and the appendix cavity is in communication with the blind, therefore has the same bacillus and anaerobic bacteria and quantity. If the appendix mucosa is slightly damaged, the bacteria invades the tube wall, causing different degrees of infection, and a few patients have occurred after the upper respiratory tract infection, so it is also believed that infection can be transmitted from the blood to the appendix, and some infection starts the suppuration of the neighboring organ Sex infection, intrusion of appendix.\\nIn other factors that are considered to be related to the onset, there is a gastrointestinal dysfunction (diarrhea, constipation, etc.) caused visceral nerve reflection, leading to appendix muscles and vasospasm.

However, it is also possible to be three different direct consequences of differential factors, due to concurrent or diffuse perparamitis, so that the pathology of acute appendicitis is more complicated.\\n(1) Single appendicitis: Mild inflammatory changes, edema is not serious; or the slurry film congestion is red, the inflammatory cell infiltration in each layer of the appendix, with the mucosal layer, and there is a superficial bleeding point Or ulcers (Figure 3), this appendicitis is mild infection, clinical symptoms and body reactions are also lighter, if it can be treated in time, can achieve inflammatory absorption, infection, and appendix can return to normal.\\n(2) Purative appendicitis: is caused by early inflammation, or due to appendectonic obstruction, the internal pressure increases, the distal blood is severely blocked, the infection is formed and spread rapidly, to cause suppurative or even honeycomb in several hours. Sex infection, appendectitis, high height of the serum surface and more purulent exudate, some or all of them are wrapped in the metric film, there is a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration in the appendicent wall, some have formed a micro abscess Or have a large amount of micro abscess, there is a pyrotype secretion in the appendix, and there is a phenomenon of obvious Escherichia coli and anaerobic bacteria, and the suppurative appendicitis can cause limitations around the appendix, or because Putting with perfumes, the appendix of this appendicitis has different degrees of tissue destruction, even if conserved recovery, the scar contracture of the appendicent wall can cause the lumen stenosis, resulting in an inflammation repeated episode (Fig. 4).\\n(3) Normalreneous appendicitis: due to aggregation of appendective purulent infection, or due to severe obstruction of appendectitis, the appendicent is completely blocked in a short period of time, and the thirtane gangrene, reaching the most serious level in appendectonic inflammation, according to The appendix blood is blocked, the appendix is \\u200b\\u200bpart or all necrosis, the necrosis is purple black, the mucosa is near all erosion, there is a blood pus in the appendix, most combined with a hole, and covered with the metric, The surrounding pus is survived or has been diffuse peritonitis. Such appendicitis can occur both in specific pathogenesis, or after clinical misdiagnosis and delay treatment, once there is a serious part, there is a dramatic The permanent reaction such as poisoning shock, there will be a result of death, so some people are synthesized to severe appendicic appendicitis, and should be prevented from occurring during the development of acute appendicitis.\\nIf the above three types of acute appendicitis is still limited to the appendix, the infection has little effect on the body, the process is easy, the effect is good, but when the appendicitis is serious, it involves four surroundings, especially concurrent perforations, infection, to the abdominal cavity, The inflammation is diffused from the appendix to some or all of the abdominal cavity, and the pathology is complicated, and it also causes difficulties in treatment.\\nAppendicitis consolidated limitant peritonitis refers to the expansion of acute appendicitis to the surrounding abdominal cavity, which can occur early or no perforations in the appendicitis, only the slurry pulsation is peripheral, and peritoneal inflammation is often due to the metric. Surrounded by the intestines, limit peritonitis produced by the accumulated purulent fluid can also be converted to an appendicular abscess due to the timely treatment, limit peritonitis may absorb disappearance, once absurly, and less respuples Surgical drainage, abscess can be more pus, high internal pressure, collapse the pus, into the wall of the pus, into the wall of the pus; or form multiple abscess in the abdominal cavity; or break into the nearby organ (intestinal, bladder, vagina) The inner fistula is formed; or the abdominal wall is formed into a sinus; or due to the aggravation of the fibrosis of the abscess, a limitative inflammatory block is formed in a tumor.\\nAppendicular perforation is a very serious pathological change in acute appendicitis. The appendicitis is serious, the progress is rapid, and the local still is not as good as a large reticulum or intestinal adhesion protection. Once the perforation, infection is very fast and all abdominal cavity, so common Normal incidents, infection involving all abdominal cavity, due to large abdominal area, large fluid, soon leading to insufficient blood volume, while bacteria and toxins in the abdominal infection have been absorbed, so that patients are in a short body During the sepsis and shock, there is often a critical condition, the mortality is very high, and the acute appendicitis is related to the peritonitis and the perforation, the perforation occurs in the gangrenic appendicitis but can also occur in the late stage of the treatment of raw appendicitis, most In the appendix obstruction site or distal, some people count 1000 acute appendicitis, the perforation accounted for 21% and only 7% of the peritonitis, the key is that the body has certain defense, large reticular, nearby mesenteric and small intestines can be quickly Attached to the hole, so that the infection caused by the appendix perforation can only diffuse and diffuse, the uterus of the infants and young children is too short, and the uterus in pregnancy is reduced. Weak and patient patients with sexual immune function, the ability to lack limit infection is easy to have a diffuse peritonitis after the appendix, must pay attention to, acute appendicitis and sepsis is also visible to severe infection of appendicent veins. Invading the vein, it is raw vermicitis or multiple liver abscess, which is rare, but has a very high mortality.\\n2, disease transfer\\nThe above different pathological types can be strong, and whether the treatment is in time, and there is different conversation.\\n(1) Inflammation regression: simple appendicitis before the mucosa has not yet formed ulcer, timely anti-inflammatory may cause inflammation to resolve the pathological changes, early suppurative appendicitis, such as the treatment, even if the inflammation saves, will be scarred, and the threshing cavity A narrow, the wall thickens, the appendix is \\u200b\\u200bdistorted, easy to relapse.\\n(2) Inflammation is limited to: suppuration or gangrene, after the hole, the appendix is \\u200b\\u200ban appendix surrounding abscess, or is adhesive into inflammatory block, which is a constant reduction in inflammation, such as pus.

Stone existence, and may be stones have been rated to the bile duct. In addition to stones, the gallbladder tube and the gallbladder pipe connection can also be small due to the smaller angle, the gallbladder tube itself is too zigzag, deformity, or abnormal blood vessels, surrounding inflammatory adhesions, insects, and swelling, the lymph nodes, etc. Functional disorder research confirms that biliary muscles, nerve dysfunction, normal emptying activities of gallbladder are blocked, causing a timely bile strand. When there is a lesion in the abdominal organ, such as stomach, duodenal ulcer, chronic appendicitis or kidney inflammation, etc., the visceral neuropathy is transmitted to the cerebral cortex, causing the dysfunction of cortex, thus reflecting gallbladder tube Splicing muscle and duodenal nipple sphincter caused sputum, resulting in bile lagging throughout the biliary system. Long-term bile in the gallbladder and concentration, which can stimulate the gallbladder mucosa, causing inflammatory lesions, plus bacterial infections, can form acute cholecysteitis.\\nAbout 70% of bacteria in acute gallbladamitis are Escherichiae, other Care Bacillus, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Sapoccus, Hampermacillus, Subtrichum, Streptococcus, and Pneumococcus, etc. About 50% acute gallbladder inflammatory positive bile bacteria culture positive.

The disease is rare in children, and it may be related to hemolysis or congenital biliary diseases. The age of 50 to 69 years old is 4 times that of low age groups, high-risk and low-bound boundary lines are 40 years old, although there is a difference in reports, but the peak age of the disease is 40 ~ 50 years old.

There is no significant gender difference. Women's cholesterol stones may be lowered to estrogen, increase bile cholecholesterol secretion, reduce total bile acid quantity and activity, and progesterone affects gallbladder motivation, so that bile stiff is related.\\nPregnancy can promote the formation of stones, and the number of pregnant is positively correlated with the incidence, which has been proven to be clinical and epidemiological research. The reasons for pregnancy prone stones are:\\n1 The increase in estrogen during pregnancy changes the bile ingredients to increase the saturation of cholesterol in bile.\\n2 The gallbladder emptying in pregnancy is lagging, and the B-ultrasound shows that the pregnant woman is in an empty stomach, the gallbladder volume increases, and the residual volume is increased, and the gallbladder shrinkage rate is reduced.\\n3 The weight change in pregnancy and post-postpartum also affects bile ingredients, and changes the liver circulation of bile acids, which promotes the formation of cholesterol crystals.\\nThere are certain differences in the incidence of different countries and regions, and Western Europe, North America and Australian stone chillitis are high, and many local gallbladder diseases in Africa are rare. The gallstones in the country and regions are also different. In Sweden, Germany and other countries are mainly cholesterol stones, while the UK has high incidence of calcium carbonate than other countries.\\nEating habits are the main factors affecting gallstones, and the incidence of high cholesterol fooders is significantly increased. Because refined carbohydrates increase bile cholesterol saturation.\\nThe difference between the incidence of stone choloritis on the race also suggests that genetic factors are one of the pathogenesis. Anyone with Indian genes is high. The study of single egg double tires is proved that the risk of gallbladder in the patient's relatives is also high, and the incidence of stone choloritis is also in advance, and there is a genetic tendency.\\nThe incidence of stone choloritis is also related to cirrhosis, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, gastrointestinal nutrition, surgical trauma, and application of certain drugs.

       " \"First, the cause of the disease\\nIt has not been determined so far. The research trend in recent years believes that this disease may be the result of genetic susceptibility and a variety of exogenous factors.\\n1, genetic susceptibility\\n(1) Genetic factors: A large amount of information indicates that crohn disease is related to genetic factors. The study found that the consistency ratio of Crohn disease between the twin sons of single eggs was significantly increased, 67%, and the twin bonus of the di-proportion, its consistency ratio was only 8%. At the same time, it was found that there were inconsistencies between Crohn patients and their spouses and was not different from ordinary people. The above indicates that the disease has a family aggregation. It has also been reported that the Jews have high incidence of this disease in the Jewish family, and found that the main areas of ASH Kenazi. In the survey of Asnezers who scattered around the world, the incidence of crohn disease is higher than the residents of non-Asnenadz people living in the same area, and maybe Asaffaz Jews represent human beings. Genetic susceptible population. There is also reported that patients with crohn disease are mostly associated with HLA-DR4 serum antigen. How genetic factors affect this disease is unclear. Some people think that genetic genes determine the immune response of the body, the genetic factors of inflammatory bowel diseases determine that their antigenic substances in some intestinal cavities have too strong immune response.\\n(2) Changes of susceptibility: Most scholars believe that Crohn disease may be related to the body's immune response to various antigen-stimulated immune responses in the intestine. More and more evidence shows that the T cells of the inherent film of Crohn patients activate, including the increase in surface signs of T cell activation, increased T cell cells, and increased cytotoxic T cell function. This increase in T cell activation has led to aggregation of effector cells such as neutral white blood cells. The destructive substances (such as proteases and reactive oxygen metabolism) were then synthesized, thereby causing Crohn. The triggering mechanism of T cell activation is unclear. Some people in the past have been convinced that the chronic mycobacterial infection is caused, but there is no reliable evidence. At present, it is considered to be single, more likely to be activated by some widely existing triggering substances. The fundamental defect of Crohn disease has led to T cells permanent in an active state, which is currently explored. It may be an exogenous antigen, an increased antigen transfer (increased intestinal osmosis) and a mucosal immune impairment of genetic tendencies. The result of complex interaction.\\nAt present, the study shows that this disease is considered to be an autoimmune disorder viewpoint is inaccurate. In fact, there is no confident evidence that there is an immune response to any autogen (this antigen can cause inflammation processes observed in crohn disease).\\n2, exogenous factors\\n(1) Infection factors: In the early years, the pathological manifestation of Crohn disease is similar to nonccalified tuberculosis, and this disease is suspected of being caused by tuberculosis, but this pathogen is not separated by various methods. In the late 1970s, KanSasii bobacillus was cultured from the intestinal segment and mesenteric lymph nodes from crohn sickness or a report similar to Nikuroacteria. The study found that these mycobacterial inoculated in the abdominal cavity of mice, granuloma occurred in their liver and spleen and anti-acid bacillus. These anti-acid bacilli were again oral, and non-cheese granuuloma occurred at the end of the sheep. Thus, mycobacterium may be the cause of crohn disease. However, the author's observations also exist in some non-inflammatory bowel disease or normal human intestinal tissues, and there have been reported that the fecal bacteria can cause local granuloma in the intestinal wall of the rabbit, so they can't affirmed these branches. Bacillus is the exact pathogenic factor of this disease.\\nSome people have doubts that the cause of crohn disease is a virus. In 1970, Mitchell and Rees were seeded in rats in rats with Crohn patients, and tissue homogenated in rats were seeded by 220 nm filtration sieve. After 6 to 24 months, the rats in rats had epithelial cell granuloma and giant cell granuloma. , Use the same method to make the rabbit back to the intestine. Immunosuppressive drugs do not affect the occurrence of lesions, which proves that there may be an infected microorganism, which may be a virus. But this experiment result failed to be repeated. It is also believed that crohn disease is associated with a virus infection such as measles, flu. However, the true viral particles have not been separated from the intestinal tissue of crohn patients, so the disease cannot be confirmed as a virus.\\n(2) Environmental factors: urban residents have high incidence of rural populations, this difference is also in Sweden, which is high in rural health, may be related to society, economic status.\\nSome studies have shown that oral contraceptives have increased the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. But other studies have failed to confirm.\\nA large number of studies have shown that smokers have increased risk of crohn disease. Moreover, smoking can increase the possibility of cruciamuria. Its mechanism is unclear.\\nSome potential environmental factors can excite Crohn disease. Increased consumption of refined sugar has been confirmed to be a disadvantage. An ordinary period can also be used as a stimulating factor to cause some pregnant women to occur in Crohn disease after childbirth.\\nSecond, the pathogenesis\\n1. Distribution of lesions: Any part of the full gastrointestinal vertex from the mouth to an anus can be affected, and the lesion is jumping or segmental distribution. The small intestine and colon are also most common, accounting for 40% to 60%; limited to small intestines, mainly 30% to 40% of the end of the episode; alone occurs less, accounting for 3%, more than small intestines and Colon lesions are incidental; fewer incidence of colon, accounting for 5% to 20%. The stomach or duodenal intestine, esophageal, and oral lesions totaled about 10% or less.\\n2, general pathology: early lesions are small ulcer, size variants. The smallest is like a needle tip, accompanied by bleeding; the bigger border is clear, the bottom is white. If the surgery is missed, the lesion is missed, and it can be recurred from the site. Typical ulcers are longitudinal or prosthetic, discontinuous, and size varies.\\nThe pebble-like change is about 1/4 cases.\\nThe intestinal wall is thickened, and the intestinal cavity is more common. There is a narrow surface in the surgical case.\\nSome crohn diseases can be seen more inflammatory polyps.\\n3, the microscope see: The microscope will become visible in the intestinal mucosa, the submucosa under the mucosa, mainly the submucosa. Common lymphocytes aggregate, there can be a hair development center. The site of lymphocyte aggregation is closely related to the lymphatic vessels of vascular and expanded lymphatic. The lymphocyte aggregation of the serial layer can form a rose stone sample. Slurry cells, multicore cells and eosinophils can also be found. The mucosa layer can be seen in the trap. Non-cheese granuloma is one of the important features of this disease. It consists of epithelial cells and giant cells. The center has no queen necrosis, and is not common, only about 50%. It should be noted that granuloma can also be found in the infection of Yerssen or Chlamydia, and experienced pathologists can be identified by tissue sections. 5% of the glass-like transitions can be seen in the form of glass samples, which are the same as those of nodular disease and tuberculosis. Grass is often very difficult, and there is a clear boundary formed by lymphocytes. It can be seen in the overall layer of the intestinal wall, but is most likely to appear under the submucosal layer and the lace film. Outside the intestinal wall, granuloma can also be found in local lymph nodes.\\nThe crack ulcer of the intestinal wall is deeply solid. Sprackers penetration is the basis for forming internal fistula and skin fistula and abscess. The fissure under the naked eye is linear, which can have a branch, surrounded by edema and island mucosa. On the cross section, the crack branch is manifested as a wall abscess.\\nDue to edema and lymphatic dilatation and the number of collagen fibers increase, the submucosa is widened, and the intestinal wall thickens.\",\n",

       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nThe exact cause of ulcerative colitis is still not clear. At present, there are several different students about the pathology of this disease.\\nInfection factors (35%):\\nCertain bacteria and viruses have been proven to play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Due to the pathological changes and clinical manifestations of the disease and the bacterial dysentery, some case feces cultivate bacteria, some cases apply antibiotic therapy effective It seems that bacterial infection is related to this disease. In 1973, Fakmer cultured a giant cell virus (Cytomegalovirus, CMV) in 6 cases of ulcerative colitis. In 1977, Cooper also separated the giant cell virus from the poisonous colon expanded patient. Some studies have found that MYCOBACTERIUM PARATUBERCULOS, a sub-mucreatular virus (measles virus paramyxovirus), monocytes increased \"Listeria Moncyto\", etc., may also be with ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. There is a pathogenesis, so some bacteria or viruses may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, but which pathogen infection causes this disease, infective pathogens is the cause of this disease or the result of further research Sure.\\nImmunological factors (28%):\\nPeople who hold this view believe that autoimmune mediated tissue damage is one of the important factors of ulcerative colitis, and authors find some pathogens (such as E. coli, etc.) and human coli epithelial cells. Cross antigen After the body infects these pathogens, the autoantibium in the circulation is not only to the pathogens in the intestinal wall, but also a 40 kD antigen from the colon epithelium in patients with ulcerative colitis in recent years. When the activation of the body produces an anti-colon epithelium, the complement and antigenic antibody complex of the colonic epithelium are activated, and the immuno-lymphocytes and macrophages in patients with ulcerative colitis can be released, and various cytokines and vascular activity can be released. Substances, promote and aggravate the inflammatory response of tissue, and reported in colonic epithelial apoptosis in CD95 (TNF) in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, found in colon inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis The apoptosis mediated by CD95-CD95L occurred in adjacent non-inflammatory regions, inference may be one of the possible causes of ulcerative colitis spread.\\nIn addition, in recent years, there have been reports that antibodies in the body circulation and T lymphocytes are combined with the heat shock protein (HSP) in the intestinal epithelial cells in patients with ulcerative colitis, resulting in damage to intestinal epithelium, in ulcers Patitis Patitis Patients with T, B lymphocyte count measurement, blood-white cells, macrophages, and lymphocyte conversion rate measurements are suggest that the disease is related to changes in cellular immunology.\\nGenetic factors (15%):\\nSome information shows that ulcerative colitis is closely related to genetic factors, and race differences are significantly higher in Caucasians. The incidence of Asians is the lowest, among which Caucasian Jews have higher incidence than non-Jews. 2 to 4 times, while the colored people are about 50%, and the morbidity of the monocellular twins is higher than the doubles of the double eggs. At the same time, the author is reported to the tissue-related antigen HLA-DR2 in patients with ulcerative colitis, increased, Japanese scholars have recently reported that the specific gene expression P-ANCA (Peinuclear Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody) associated with the patients in patients with ulcerative colitis is significantly higher than the normal population.\\nSpiritual factors (15%):\\nThe role of psychoamples in the incidence of ulcerative colitis can cause autonomic disorders to cause autonomic disorders, leading to intestinal wall inflammation and ulceration formation, but there are authors to control patients with ulcerative colitis and normal populations and found in disease episodes. There is no obvious spiritual incentive. On the contrary, after ulcerative colitis, there is a significant improvement in the symptoms of the patient\\'s original mental illness such as depression, anxiety, and tension, and other symptoms. It seems that the spiritual factors are not caused. The cause of the disease is more like this caused by this disease.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\n1. The ulcerative colitis in the lesion can occur in any part of the collateral, more common in rectum and ethyl colon, can also be tired and tired and other parts of the columns, or increasing the entire colon, a small number of full colon is involved in the end. The accumulated intestinal tube is limited to the end of the endonicity within 10cm, and the 78 cases of ulcerative colitis in the Surgery of the People\\'s Hospital of Beijing Medical University, 38 cases of the full colorectors, accounting for 48.7%, rectum and ethyl colon (32 cases ( 41%), oligand, cadamic and raised colon accumulated 8 cases, accounting for 10.2%, 5 cases (6.4%) (6.4%).\\n2, pathological form\\n(1) General morphology: ulcerative colitis is a mucosa-based inflammation, and its complimentary should have fewer cases, so the specimen of the collaborative surgical resection does not have more diseases, the lace film is generally complete Outside the outer view, gloss, blood vessels, intestinal shortening, the most obvious intestinal colon and rectum, generally not seeing the fibrous tissue hyperplasia, the intestinal mucosa has a grain feeling, crisp, extensive congestion and bleeding, there are multiple superficial Ulcer, a linear distribution along the columula or plaque distribution, severe cases visible mucosal flakes, even exposing the muscle layer, the mucosal lesion is continuous, starting from the rectum or ethyl colon, often long, nearly light, recent lateral light, Left semi-junction, the right semi-junction, the surface of the mucosa can also be seen, the inflammatory polyps of different sizes, the morphology, the rectum, the rectum, sometimes the inflammatory polyps are formed with each other Mucosal bridge.\\n(2) Tissue morphology: mucous membrane and mucous membrane height congestion, edema, inflammatory cells diffuse infiltration, mainly neutral granulocytes, lymphocytes, slurry cells and macrophages, initially inflammation is limited to mucosa, in epithelial and gland After damage, inflammation can evolve into the mucosa, generally non-tired and lace film, neutral granulocytes infiltrate into the intestinal epithelium, can cause hilariitis and crypt abscess, epithelial cell proliferation, cup cells reduce or disappear, small The ulcer is more than the mucosa, which is diffuse distribution. The bottom can be mucous membrane under the sub-layer, very small and all levels, and only thin granulation tissue in the bottom of the ulcer.\\nThe naked eye observation has been repaired to achieve a completely relieved case, and its colon mucosa is difficult to distinguish between normal mucosa, but the pathological examination still has abnormal changes, which is irregular, and has branches, cup-shaped cells, increased cells, Pan Cell chemical, and thus, ulcerative colitis is mostly pathological changes to: 1 diffuse continuous mucosa, 2 mucosa ulcers, 3 hidden abscess, 4 pseudotype, 5 special cell changes, Pan Ban cell proliferation, cup Cell reduction.',\n",

The other end is the blind end. After the pouft intestinal content, it is necessary to discharge it by means of peristalsis. Most of the genus of the elderly weaken, which may also affect the appendix, so that the paste in the cavity is absorbed and become a manure, block the appendix. In addition, the fruit cores that are not digested in the food, etc., it is not easy to discharge after entering the appendix. The second is that the appendectogeneous membrane is relatively short, and the appendix is \\u200b\\u200bdistorted and the obstruction can be shrunk when the appendix mucosa is aging, and the fibrous tissue hyperplasia can also cause appendix the narrowness, affecting the appendix peristalsis and emptying.\\n2. Bacterial infection: E. coli, enterococcus, and anaerobic bacteria, etc., due to the barrier function of the appendix mucosa, so that the bacteria cannot enter the appendix mucosa.

In recent years, with the development and application of microbiological identification technology and molecular biology, many new intestinal pathogens, but still 20% ~ 35% of diarrhea patients have failed to detect the cause, and known as \"Non-specific acute gastroenteritis\". Regarding the reports of pathogens, there is a matter of case, depending on the local epidemic pathogenic spectrum, pasta (poison) strain and local people\\'s immune status. Within the world, the biopsy, ETEC, is considered to be the most common pathogens, accounting for 40% to 70%, and its high detection rate is especially in Africa and Central America. Recently, the adhesion-accumulated Escherichia coli (EAEC) has recently been pathogens in the world. Shiga is also quite common in the world, and jejuno curved bacteria is more common in travelers to Asia. Although cholera is an important diarrhea disease in India and Latin America, it rarely invaders travelers. Thailand\\'s aerosolis is particularly common. In the coastal areas of Southeast Asia, the sub-hemorrus is more common. Travelers can occlude diarrhea due to viruses, protests and worms, but the three add only 10% to 15% of travelers.

Further, the pathological spirit such as depression or social distance is significantly improved after colon resection. .\\nIt is believed that ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune disease. Many patients have antibodies with normal colon epithelial and specific intestinal bacterial lipopolysaccharide anti-primary, and lymphocytes are cultured by colitis. It turned into cytotoxicity to colon epithelial, in addition, there was a change in T and B lymphocyte population of colitis, but later realized that these abnormalities were not necessarily necessary, but the results of disease activities, in fact, Brandtzueg et al.

Therefore, it is possible that IgG has a chronic process of disease. Role, but has nothing to do with the occurrence of disease.\\nIn summary, the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is currently the result of exogenous substances caused by the interaction of the host reaction, gene and immunization. According to this, chronic ulcerative colitis and clonal disease is a different manifestation of a disease process. Since the host is allergic to the antigens of exogenous substances, once the intestinal immunity is established - perhaps this start-up is based on the period of microbial microbial cloning - any injury to these antigen permeability, may induce the intestine The inflammatory response of the wall, the type of antigen and other factors determine the nature of the inflammatory process, i.e., clonal or ulcerative colitis.\\nUlcerative colitis is a disease limit in the colon mucosa and submucosa, which has distinctly distinctly distinctly distinctive changes in the intestinal wall of colon cloning, the latter is involvement in the graft wall in the granulation swollen disease, but The pathological changes in ulcerative colitis are not specific, or they can also be seen in bacterial dysentery, amba dysentery and gonococcal colitis.\\nAt the beginning of the lesions, the mucous membrane substrate Lieberkülin contaminated circle cells and neutral multicore cell infiltration, forming a hood abscess, and the epithelial cells that can be seen under light glasses are shallow and void formation, and the mitochondria is swollen in the electron microscope, and the cell gap is widened.

Each bowel movement will squeeze a large amount of blood from the exposed granulation surface. Early X-rays showed that the intestinal bag disappeared is the mucosa muscles, the colon Short shrinkage and stiff, the chimney tube is a result of repeated damage to scar after repeated damage.\\nMost ulcerative colitis is involved in the rectum, but if the lesion is limited to the rectum, it can be called ulcerative rectalitis.

When the medium-dose occurs, it is an indicator of inflammation activity, and surface mucus disappears. Cell denaturation necrosis, a large number of neutral granulocytes into the adenopathy, form an adenocardia (tube type), and the regeneration of the gland is greatly affected, and the neutral granular cell infiltration is clear, bacterial and cells The contact rate is decreased, which may be the result of the immune response, and the bacterial surface is circumferentially contacted with cells by IgG.\\nThe genetic tendency of A-type gastritis (gastritis) VARIS and Siurala have done a lot of work, and they have found that the incidence of psychotomogenesis is significantly higher than that of ordinary population, and the risk of severe atrophic gastritis is random The crowd is 20 times, they think that the role is a common chromosome dominant genetic gene, and the research on gastric sinus is found to have a family aggregation.

The function of CFTR has not yet been clear, but it is obviously part of CAMP-adjusted chloride channels, and regulates the transfer of chlorine, sodium sprocket membranes, and there is no abnormal clinical symptoms of heterozygos, but there is a mild abnormality in the presence of epithelial cell membrane transport.\\nCystic fibrosis is a common-stained hidden genetic disease that is caused by the sediment CF gene mutation. The patient is a homogenic, and its parents are hybrids. The half of the patient's compatriots can have a recessive gene, while 1/4 can be sick. Generally, heterozygous genes with hidden genes account for 2% to 5% of newborns, and there is a disease in 2000 to 2,500 newborn. The pathogenesis of capsule fibrotic exteration gland can be unclear. Studies have shown that the patient's epithelial cell chloride channel regulates defects, the water of the respiratory mucosa epithelium, the electrolyte transmembrane transport is obstacted, and the content of acid glycosaccharide in the mucidal adenoy increases, and the characteristics of the mucus flow change can be changed.

Reduction.\\nPathogenesis\\nAlthough the pathogenesis of spleen function needs further discuss, according to the physiological function of the spleen, there are several kinds of learning:\\n1, excessive observation: blood vessels in the spleen, special, blood cells in the sinus, slopes, longer, sinus cells and red marrow, macrophages, blood cells filtered, have been identified Under normal circumstances, most of the hemata is abnormal, an abnormal hemorrhoids, abnormal hemoglobin structure, cell membranes are injured or by antibodies, these blood cells are usually in the spleen The internal block is damaged, and the normal human spleen is not red blood cell or white blood cell storage, but about 1/3 platelet and part of lymphocytes are restored in the spleen. When the spleen has a significant swollen rational, not only more Platelets 50% to 90%, and lymphocytes were reduced in the spleen, and more than 30% of red blood cells were reduced in the spleen, resulting in a reduction in platelets and red blood cells in surrounding blood.\\n2, over-screening and phagocytosis: Spleen monocontrol - macrophage system is excessively active, while abnormal red blood cells such as spherical cells and antibodies, oxidants or other chemical poisons, physical factors, etc., obvious Increased and cleared for macrophages, resulting in a significant reduction in red blood in the surrounding blood, and there are some red blood cell membranes, or the plasma in the slurry. Nourish. When the spleen enters the blood sinus, common red blood cells are clamped by its femoral body or hell-adhesive body, and finally the sinus wall macrophages are removed, while the red blood cell membrane is damaged. After repeated damage, the red blood cells become spherical cells, and it is not possible to be swallowed by the base film aperture.\\n3, body fluid factor: There are scholars to propose spleen to produce certain secretions to inhibit bone marrow blood cell formation and maturation, and also inhibit the release function of mature blood cells within bone marrow. Once the inhibitory factors are released, the abnormal performance of bone marrow cells will return to normal. It has been proven: 1 spleen immersion liquid injects animals to reduce their blood cells. 2 After the spleen, the patient's tolerance of radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be the result of removing body fluid factors.\\n4, immunization factor: It is considered to be a type of spleen function is an autoimmune disease. The spleen can generate antibodies, destroy their blood cells, and reduce the surrounding blood cells, bone marrow has compensatory hyperplasia, such as immunotype platelet reduction purpura And autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the spleen is the main place to produce antibodies, and it is also a place to destroy blood cells. When the spleen is removed, blood and bone marrow are often improved.\\n5, dilution: When the spleen is swollen, the total plasma has increased significantly, and the blood dilution can be reduced, and the anemia is a double role due to the treatment of spleen to blood cells and dilution of spleen anemia.

       " \"Cause:\\nThe cause of this syndrome is not very clear, it may be related to the innate abnormalities, inflammation and abuse of laxatives. This dysfunction is likely to be a functional disorder of normal muscles, rather than the persistent spasm of abnormal muscles, because the anusal pressure and electromovic can prove that the function of the outer sphincter is normal when the anus is stationary and closed. Some patients' fecal colon passes the time delay, and there is no earnings for the secondary colorectomy, so the smooth passage of the pelvic condensation patients should be considered as the feces caused by the export across the export, rather than The driving force of the colon decreases.\\nIn 1993, Stelzner found that the persistent constipation of patients with basins in pelvic spasm syndrome was related to the increase of sphincter. Poetle of spasm syndrome may also be related to the dysfunction of the nervous system, as the stimulation of the susceptor can treat the basin bottom spasm syndrome. The mechanism of action may be to make the nerve fibers of the conductive haptic, especially the A [beta] fiber, and the A [beta] fiber produces a sudden inhibition, inhibiting the passage of the spinal cord motor neurons, thereby causing the muscles that produce spasm. Like all functional diseases, pottex syndrome may be related to psychological factors.\",\n",

The study believes that children's absorption rate of lead can be up to 50%.\\nEat excessive lead drug (20%):\\nBlack Tie Dan, Miguo, etc., can cause acute poisoning. Lead can also be absorbed by the respiratory tract such as lead-containing tattoo powder (inhaled by a baby), which can cause infant to inhale poisoning. Pediatric life can often inhale a certain amount of lead-headed lead workers in the surrounding environment, which can always brought back home to pollutant dust, allowing their children to often inhale dust containing lead toxic lead poisoning. .\\nOther (20%):\\nThe industries of contact with lead are: lead mine mining, printing castings, castles, ship construction, welding, and production batteries, cables, paints, ceramic paints, glaze, lead glass, bullets, pharmaceutical, plastic stabilizers, etc. During the production process, lead in two forms of dust or soot, auto emphysema contains lead, and the large amount of emissions can pollute the atmosphere. In daily life, it is possible to use lead containers to store food, beverages, and excessive lead drugs such as Changdan, Black Tie Dan, etc., may cause accidental lead poisoning.\\nPathophysiology\\n1, lead absorption, distribution and discharge\\nThe normal person enters 300 μg lead every day, of which about 10% can be absorbed. The lead of the respiratory tract is less than 40% can be absorbed. After lead absorption, it enters the blood, distributed in soft tissue such as liver, spleen, kidney, brain, etc. After the lead in the body, the lead in the body, 90% -95% lead storage in the bone, absorbing the lead in vivo mainly discharged from the kidney, a small portion of the feces, saliva, sweat, milk, etc., each day lead absorbance exceeds 0 5 mg can accumulate and toxicity.\\nBlood, lead tissue is transportable lead, with biological activity, which exceeds normal, but there is lead absorption when there is no poisoning symptoms, and excess lead can produce toxicity, and lead in bone is stored lead, non-biological activity, blood lead, The soft tissue lead and skeletal lead are in a dynamic equilibrium, in the case of infection, drinking, sour, etc., lead transport into blood and soft tissue in the bones can cause poisoning.\\n2, poisoning mechanism\\nThe toxicity of lead and its inorganic compounds is related to the amount of lead in the body. The lead compound of the particles is easily inhaled by the respiratory tract, and the lead compound having a large concentrated solubility is easily absorbed. Therefore, the toxicity is large, and the lead in the body is easily combined with the protein. Severases containing mercaptogenic enzymes, especially those related to hemorrin synthesis. Lead inhibiting red blood cell δ-amino-R-ketopolane dehydrated enzyme (ALAD) increases serum and urine δ-amino-R-ketoproachic acid (ALA), lead inhibits flutterine primary decarboxylase, causing urine manure Increased porphyrin, lead inhibits heme synthetase, interfering iron and protoporphorphosis bind to hematar, affecting hemoglobin production, and results in young red intracellular accumulatory iron (form looped ferrous cells) and free protoporphosis (FEP) ), Free protoporphyrin and zinc chelation to form zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP).\\nLead poisoning visible points of rainbow cells increased, which is due to lead inhibits red blood cell pyrimidine-5-nucleotide plum, which degrades erythrocytenesin nucleotide, and also hinders the degradation of ribosome RNA. Degradation of pyrimidine nucleotides and ribosome RNA forms a basophilic point.\\nLead is attached to the red blood cell membrane, interferes with Na +, K + ATP enzyme, and increase the brittleness of red blood cells and is easy to hemolysis.\\nIn recent years, ALA can be passed by blood brain barriers. When lead poisoning, a large amount of ALA enters brain tissue can cause various behaviors and nerve effects.

Alkaline chemicals lead to tissue liquefied necrosis, and can penetrate into the deep tissue of esophageal walls, and severe people can cause the esophageal wall full of ulceration. Acidic chemicals lead to tissue coagulation necrosis, and the degree of damage caused by esophageal tissue is generally more alkaline chemicals, but high concentration acid chemicals can also be severely damaged.

The third, 10% is located in the fourth part, and the secondary sexual divertes are in the first part of the duodenum, and about 85% of the diverticulum is located in the second part of the duodenum, most of which are also near the nipple. Since the diverticulum is closely related to the blood vessels and gallbladder tube passing through the duodenal intestines, it is considered that the duodenal intestinal dialogue is gradually formed by the intestinal wall through this weak point, and the diverticulum is more in the pancreas surface or Behind the pancreas, even in the pancreatic tissue, it can therefore cause obstruction to produce complications such as cholangitis and pancreatitis.\\n2. The pathological changes in the size of the diverticulum, the shape is different, and the intestinal pressure affects and the length of the intestinal pressure and the length of time of the diverticulum are generally 0.5 ~ 10cm size, the shape can be circular, elliptical or tubular, etc. The size of the part is related to the symptoms.

C3A is produced, binds to receptor C3 of eosinophilic surface.\\n2. Foreign scholars Oyaizu et al. Point out that the disease is related to IgE induced fat cells release eosinophil chemokine.\\n3. Another scholar Mishra et al, believes that eosinophils participate in the host defense mechanism, under the action of hypersensitivity, fatty cytokines can trigger inflammation, and then release inflammatory media, such as IL-5, IL- 3, eosinophil chemokine, etc., thereby causing most eosinophils to activate, resulting in the occurrence of this disease.\\n4.

Allergic said: RPF is often accompanied by abdominal aortic aneurysm, severe aortic wall calcification, ureteral obstruction, peroperative peroperative inflammation, etc., recent Bullock suggests that RPF is a arterial wall that is thin from introphiliated spot A allergic reaction caused by leaking out insoluble inflammatory fat, thereby responding to \"chronic aorta surrolic\", sometimes in macrophages and lymphatic in atherosclerotic vessels and atherosclerotic plaques A non-soluble polymer of oxidizing fat and protein is found. The substance contains IgG, and a small amount of IgM, which may be the result of certain autoimmune reactions, especially for steroid hormone therapy. This argument can be confirmed.\\n2. Wheat Cylindrics: Graham reported 2 cases of patients with methylene necrosis, and thereafter, a group of 27 cases of combination of wheat necrosis treated with RPF, and stopped this medicine Some cases return to normal, the above phenomenon suggests that the methylene cinoids are causing causal and RPF. In contrast, Blandy et al., The RPF reported by the UK has not taken this drug or any other wheat-class compound. 5-hydroxyamine blocker, by increasing endogenous 5-hydroxylamine levels, Graham proposed by the competitive inhibition of the receptor site, in susceptible patients, 5-hydroxyamine can cause abnormal fibrosis reactions of cancer syndrome, 2-bromocriptine is a derivative of the wheat alkaloid, but is not 5-hydroxyamine blocker, may also be related to the peritoneal and longitudinal fibers, may cause allergies or itself by wheat alkaloids. Immune response, but there is no satisfactory evidence.\\n3. Other reasons: Some people propose RPF related to painkillers; some people suspect and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, but Pryor believes that this drug is used to treat high blood pressure caused by RPF. Instead of this cause.\\nThe pathological characteristics are centered on the lower portion of the abdomen, there is a fine fibrous tissue strip, and there is an extension to the blood vessel of the iliac vessel, or the upper edge is usually in the renal artery, but the fibrosis occasionally occurs. Around the thoracic aorta, it is characterized by a flat, solid gray-white fiber plaque, the boundary line is usually clearly free. When the disease is expanded, the abdominal gap organ structure is wrapped, but does not violate these structures. Wall, typical final bilateral ureteral is surrounded.\\nHistological changes: there is a different degree of inflammatory changes in fiber tissue, which seems to have a chronic period with less vascular relativity from a large number of lymphocytes, slurry cells and some eosinophils, small blood vessels. Cooksey examines 10 cases of surgical biopsy materials, which believes that histological changes are independent of the disease period, and the ureteral tissue edema, the ureteral tissue of the bladder, the Suburothelial Layey lymphocyte infiltration, myocyclic fibrosis, the fibrous tissue can have calcified points, All lymphatic tubes in the spot is close to the neighboring tissue, and the ureteral \"block\" may be related to its peristaltic function.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nAlmost all cases are the final stage of the course, that is, the ureteral and large blood vessel occurs. At this time, the naked eye seeing the lesion is flat, solid, no gray-white fiber plaque, and the denseness is bonded to the middle of the abdominal, general thickness number cm The thickness can be up to 12cm, the fiber plaque has a clear edge, generally limited between the third lumbar spine and the sacral, no more than the outer side of the ureteral trail, the total artery and the lower chain vena cava, the fiber tissue Around, a few lesions are up to the kidney, even through the passage to the mediastinal, and the pelvic cavity is issued.\\nAnother manifestation of the peritoneal ureteral fibrosis is that the fiber tissue is wrapped around the side or both sides, the mid-section ureteral, and other parts are normal, and the microscope is changed to be a subaraciper, non-specific, has different degrees of fiber adipose tissue inflammatory response , With fiber tissue as the main component with multinuclear white cells, lymphocytes, monocytes infiltration, inter-fat cell accumulation and hardened fatting, some parts have special dense peritoneal fiber bundles, and glass-like variability, disease first It originated from the middle, the venom vessel, and the end of the ureteral, and the tube wall generally did not be obvious.',\n",

Medical injury\\nIncluding the wounds and surgical injuries caused by gastroscopy, etc. There is a lesion such as inflammation, ulcer or tumor, which can sometimes cause complications such as gastric bleeding, perforations.\\nSurgical sources of medical sources can be caused by anatomical difficulties and operational mistakes. For example, when the spleen cuts are tapped by the stomach, the gastrointestinal wall is damaged by the stomach is too close to the stomach; the highly selective vagus nerve cut is tear-tuned or dissected. Local ischemic necrosis during stomach; isolation of the gastric sinus and the twelve mesophages during the biliary or right semi-colorectomy, damage the gastric sinus; the stomach bend may be sewing the needle during the chest repair Tear, etc., these accidents can generally find and instantly repaired at the time, and a few cases are caused by local ischemia due to improper operation of local ischemia. Complications.\\nIn addition to some of the above reasons, there is also a case report of the gastric perforation of the gastric perforation due to the excessive heart extrusion in vitro.\\n4. Gastrointestinal foreign matter\\nOccasionally, the deliberate suicide or mentally patient patients may swallow foreign bodies in the stomach, and most foreign matter can discharge itself. When the object is too large, the two ends are too sharp or a saw toothed object is difficult to discharge, which can cause obstruction, bleeding, or even perforation.\\n5. Spontaneous rupture\\nAdult spontaneous stomach rupture is extremely rare, this name does not mean that there is no background factor, and the stomach suddenly ruptured. It is generally believed that the important prerequisite caused by this disease is the spasm obstruction of the stomach exit (cardia or Hi.). In the case of expanding the stomach, severe vomiting occurs, it is too strong, or the weight, etc. may cause the stomach wall to cause breakage, and the literature has also reported a large number of small soda or anesthesia to swallow a large number of anesthesiic gases. Excessive expansion of gastric stomach caused gastric rupture.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nThe damage and its pathological changes in the stomach caused by foreign violence will be described in detail below.\\nNon-permeable injury\\nWhen the upper abdomen is blunt damage, the damage of the stomach is not common, because it is not like the liver, spleen tissue is easy to break, unlike duodenum and duodenal intestinal episode, and it is also a rib Protection, only when the stomach is full of food or gas liquid; the front wall of the stomach and the large bend are more contact with the abdominal wall peritoneal, the filling the stomach is not free to move, and the possibility of the stomach is greatly increased.\\nUnder blunting (poison, foot kicking, impact, etc.), the abdominal wall can have complete damaged damage, while the stomach wall shows different degrees of damage, the stomach pulp layer (mostly in the small bend) has a crackler, There is no obvious clinical symptom, the stomach wall is contusuous and the hematoma is formed in the gastric wall, and there is no symptom in the stomach wall, but this hematoma has been subjected to an abscess, and the gastric wall is necrotic, causing secondary peritonitis, severe Damage caused the full-stage rupture of the stomach wall, the risk is the largest, at this time, most of the liver, spleen, colon, and ribs may also break, the air waves or water waves formed at the time of rupture, and the pressure is often caused by the stomach wall. Or the whole layer rupture, after the patient is severely vomiting or dringing, it can follow the esophageal cardia mucosal cracking, it is called Mollary-Weiss syndrome, which is a rare upper disintegration bleeding, Gan Jianhui and other meetings To a male patient after 1 case high-pressure injury, the stomach and emulsion were perforated due to acute peritonitis.\\n2. Penetration damage\\nThe gastric penetrating damage is often in the same manner as its adjacent organ damage, and the damage of the stomach is often more than one place, often through the trauma, Ogilvie (1944) reported 628 abdominal injury, including 24 cases of gastric injury The mortality rate was 50%, and Wolff (1955) was analyzed by 416 stomach and turned into the incidence of 13.2% of all abdominal injury; 90% of these cases accompanied by other abdominal injuries, especially in transverse injuries See (47.10%), the mortality rate is 40.6%, higher than the colon, small intestine and liver, spleen damage, spleen damage, the gastric penetration damage is very high, because the gastric injury is often damaged by other organs Therefore, simple gastric damage is better, because the gastric walls are strong, and the stomach contents are not like the contents of the colon and the small intestine contain multiple bacteria.\\n3. Surgical injury\\nThe stomach wall was accidentally damaged, and most of them were seen in the spleen removal. When cutting off the gastric spleen ligament, the stomach wall of the stomach bend may be clamped and cut, and when the biliary repeated operation, due to its own lesion and before Substant surgery often makes the stomach and duodenity together with the transverse intestine and the macaper, even the abdominal wall is also difficult to separate, so it is also very likely to hurt the stomach and duodenum, etc., these accidents If the accident is found at the time, the damage of the stomach wall is generally not difficult to sew, and it usually does not cause serious consequences; however, if it is not possible to be aware of, it will be seriously sewed, and a peritonitis or a fistula will be formed.',\n",

       " 'Physiology research has confirmed that plasma albumin and globulin decomposition products, only about 10% from the intestines, so it is considered that the loss of gastrointestinal proteins under normal life is negligible.\\nThere are three main pathogenesis of protein loss of gastrointestinal diseases:\\n1. Gastrointestinal mucosa erosive or ulcer causes protein to ooze or leak.\\n2. Mucosa cell injury or deletion, the intercellular tight connection increases, resulting in an increase in mucosa permeability, plasma protein leaks into the intestinal cavity.\\n3. Intestinal lymphatic, intestinal mass pressure increases, but the protein-rich intestinal matter is not only maintained in alone or absorbed into the blood circulation, but it has spilled, enters the intestinal cavity. The mechanism of intestinal inflammation causes protein loss of gastrointestinal diseases is not clear, which may be due to inflammatory zone extracellular fluid and inflammatory liquid seepage. Under normal circumstances, there is not much plasma protein that leaks the gastrointestinal tract, and it is estimated that these proteins do not receive 6% of the blood circulation albumin, only 10% to 20% of these plasma proteins per day, 90% of them After digestion, re-absorb, therefore, the decomposition metabolism of gastrointestinal tract does not dominate the total decomposition metabolism of plasma protein. When the protein is lost, the plasma protein has a loss from the gastrointestinal tract. The degradation rate of proteins in the gastrointestinal tract can be up to 40% to 60% of the total circulatory plasma protein. Protein loss of gastrointestinal disease is not related to the molecular weight of the gastrointestinal tract. Plasma proteins leaked a lot of gastrointestinal tract, resulting in a half-life of plasma protein shortened, and the turnaround rate accelerated. Studies have shown that when the plasma protein leaves from the gastrointestinal mucosa, the slower the synthesis ratio is slower, the longer the mixed plasma protein decreases. The half-life of albumin and IgG is longer, even if the body is compensated, the capacity is limited, and the rate of the liver synthetic albumin can be increased by 1 degree; while the synthesis of immunoglobulin such as IgG is not stimulated by plasma concentration. Therefore, the plasma concentration of albumin and IgG is the highest during this disease, so that the patient is often accompanied by hyphenemia. Fast turnover, half-life plasma protein, such as transferron protein, copper blue protein, IgM, etc., it is only slightly reduced during this disease. The fibrinogen is the shortest half-life, the fastest synthesis rate, so the plasma concentration is generally normal. The protein lost into the gastrointestinal cavity is decomposed into amino acids in the intestinal cavity, and the peptide is absorbed into the blood circulation. As the nitrogen source of the body, if there is more protein mass of the gastrointestinal tract, the velocity of the intestine is faster or The intestinal force is faster, and a large amount of protein is discharged from the intestine. Due to intestinal lymphatic vessel obstruction, proteins are lost from intestinal tract, and lymphocytes can be reduced from parenteral loss and blood lymphocytes. In addition, other plasma components such as copper, calcium, iron, lipids can also be lost from the gastrointestinal tract.',\n",

       " \"Stem cells have various raw carcinoma genes and tumor suppressor genes. In most cases the characteristics of the raw carcinoma gene are not expressed, and there is no carcinogen, so it is not possible to develop into a gas cancer cell. Anti-carcinoma family of gastric cancer may be more likely to be expressed, this is the genetic factor. In addition to the inner factors such as genetic, there are many external carcinogenic factors, such as the various non-genetic factors facing the above high-risk populations, can also directly induce or long-term destroying the gastric mucosa barriers to make the cancer substance more easily induced stem cell cancer gene expression or gene. The mutation produces carcinogens, making new immature original cells not differentiation into gastric mucosa epithelial cells having normal functions, but become non-normal cells that have different degrees of differentiation and raising. If the body's immunization monitoring is normal, a small amount of abnormal cells can often be removed, but when the long-term state is not good, the endocrine system is abnormal and the immune function is low, or abnormal cells escape the immunization monitoring of the body due to certain unknown reasons, it is abnormal The cells ultimately develop into a body that cannot control its growth of gastric cancer cells to complete the cancerous process.\",\n",
       " \"(1) Causes of the disease\\nSmall intestinal damage is caused by direct violence and indirect violence, mainly in the abdominal blunt injury, caused by empty back sausages caused by falling or sudden deceleration, etc. During the fall of the intestinal distance, within 50cm, the traumatic damage is generally divided into closed intestinal damage, open intestinal injury and medical intestinal damage.\\nClosed intestinal damage\\nAccording to the principle of violence, it can be divided into four cases.\\n(1) Direct violence is injuried: lumbosacralular morbid strips are more close to the abdominal wall than other spine, direct violence acting on the abdominal wall and causes the small intestines or including the membrane damage to the lumbar vertebral direction, under the direct action of strong external force, The intestine is squeezed between the abdominal wall and the spine or the hubular state caused the small intestine, which is severely cut off the small intestine, from the injury of the neutral part of the umbilical part, sometimes accompanied by the breakage, contusion of the intestinal membrane, Bleeding, slightly in the outer force of the body axis can simultaneously combine the damage of liver, spleen, kidney, colon, when the abdomen is seriously violent, can be closed at the same time due to duodenal epithelium and ileum, so that the upper stage is closed Hey, the pressure in the intestinal cavity increases, which often occurs after having a full meal, and the fracture punch occurs frequently away from the small intestinal sidanes of the intestinal content of the intestinal content of the violent extruded site.\\n(2) Side violent injury: External force can also act in the abdomen in the direction along the body axis, so that the intestine is rapidly moved to one side, and when the range of movement exceeds the ability of the fixed intestinal membrane or ligament, It may cause the intestinal tear from which the intestine is accompanied by the good intestinal starting portion near the Treitz ligament near the Treitz ligament or the endometrical end of the impetuous, and this damage can also occur in the abdominal inflammatory lesion. Abdominal surgery or acceptance of intraperitoneal treatment, causes abdominal pathological adhesion, intestinal and abdominal walls or surrounding tissues, and organ fixation, from side violence can also cause the pressure to increase in a partial intestinal tube, originally charged flatulence The intestine is not as follows of evacuation, or there is room for the intestinal intestinal intestines. When the fluid pressure in the intestinal cavity is sharply increased, the intestinal wall membrane membrane membrane implantation in the external force can cause the intestinal burst or A small perforation occurred, the diameter is typically 0.5 cm, and the surrounding intestinal wall and the membrane are normal, which is easily omissible when it is probably.\\n(3) Indirect violence, injuries: more occurrence in the force mechanism of anti-intestinal inertia movement, when the patient is falling, falling, suddenly, when the intestinal or substantial resistance, the vertical change of this position suddenly changes the pressure. The small intestinal breakage or tear is caused by conduction, which occurs in the fixed level of the small intestine, such as the vicinity of the empty back to the irregularity of the back abdominal wall and the maximum free degree, more common in the total amount of food, Small intestines in a full state.\\n(4) Self-contracted injuries in their own muscles: Improper body is suddenly striped back to make the abdominal muscles strongly contracted, and the pressure of the abdominal pressure causes the small intestine or the membrane to tear, and some are the abdominal systolicism against the normal movement of the intestinal tube. The abdominal muscle self-contraction caused a small amount of small intestinal rupture, and the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University has accredited 1 case of 76-year-old male patients. Due to the cooperation with others, it will gradually appear abdominal pain and peritoneal stimulus. The surgery confirmed that there was 0.5 cm to rupture at 150 cm from the back to the blind portion, and the mucosa valgus.\\n2. Open intestinal injury\\nMainly induced by sharp injuries, such as bomb injuries, shrapnel or ball injuries, sharp injuries, open small intestinal damage must have foreign matter into or abdominal cavity, may be a single single-invasive mouth injury may also be injured many times. The impaired bowel can be kept away from the wound part, often causing multiple intestinal rupture or composite injury.\\n3. Medical intestinal damage\\nMedical small intestinal injury occurs, common causes, if surgical separation adhesions, there is unintentionally damaged intestinal tube, abdominal puncture, stabbed impeller, unexpected injury, endoscopic operation, and accidental abortion surgery accidentally injured small intestines Incidence of intestinal perforation or intestinal cracking, sometimes damage to the empty blood vessel formation hematoma.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nThe pathological changes in small intestinal injury are determined in the degree and site of the small intestine and the incompatible injuries.\\nClosed intestinal damage\\nThe pathology of closed intestinal damage is the contusion, hematoma and rupture of the intestinal wall. When the slight intestinal wall is contused, the injured bowel is only partial congestion, edema, and the tissue continuity of the intestinal wall is not damaged. The blood supply is still a lot. Healing, severe contusion allows the injured intestinal mucosa to lose its integrity, the range of local ischemia exceeds the degree of paid compensation, and ultimately develops into ulcers, the intestinal wall necrosis occurs, perforation, intestinal content and bacteria Self-perforated intestinal walls entered the abdominal inner cavity, and the huge narrow narrow narrow shape of the intestine may be formed after the galvanic wall healing.\\nThe pathological changes after intestinal wall crack varies depending on the depth and range of damage, and the simple lace film layer with a small mucosa cracking and a wide range of simple mucosa, which can rely on the body's own repair capability Injury healing, no obvious clinical symptoms, there is no sequelae, damage to the cracking of the pulp muscle layer, can have obvious osmaste and inflammatory changes, and even in the damaged portion, if the mucosa crack, the mucosa, the mucosa can be partially bleeding Based on the infection and intestinal perforation, it is necessary to emphasize the treatment initiative to prevent the presence of heaviness without serious complications.\\nEmpty back to the abdominal cavity is free from other organs, and the blood vessel damage causes the blood and swelling. The upper and the intestines and the intestinal intestinal tube are relatively fixed, the membrane is short, the lack of buffering ability, and the intestinal film can be damaged after the external force is directly active. The intravenous or mesenter-film intravenous and its branch blood vessels, formation of hematoms, serious threats to the intestinal wall, a small amount of persistent bleeding can spread along the intestine to develop blood, the blood of the intestine, the blood and swelling to a certain degree can be broken Membrane or mucous membranes, severe blood loss shock or death, secondary intestinal ulcer, perforation, abdominal abscess, peritonitis, etc. can occur on the basis of hematoma.\\n2. Open intestinal injury\\nOpen intestinal damage is characterized by the abdominal wall and the intestine, sometimes it can be seen from the abdominal wall wound, and must pay attention to the outlet and the inlet of the foreign body to find the exit and the inlet of the foreign body. Most wounds are counterparts, the ballistic ballistics of the bullet injury It can sneak a distance in the intestinal cavity, resulting in a distance of two rupture ports on the surface of the bowel surface, the large number of shrapnel damage is limited, and the steel ball bomb may cause bowel damage, small rupture, small distribution It is easy to be missing, and when the trajectory of the damage is tangential direction, the penetration occurs in the intestinal cavity or the damage to the other side of the intestinal wall may have only one rupture.\\nThe pathological changes of open small intestinal injury are mainly peritonitis. Small perforations have only a very small amount of intestinal content into the abdominal cavity. In addition to the local peritonitis, there is no other symptoms, and the small intestinal damage is large, or the time is time to visit, can be abdominal wall Open inlets and out of gastrointestinal contents or overflow gases, more severe damage may flow out of blood or damaged bowel, retinal, etc. via the abdominal wall wound.\",\n",

       " \"There is no clear conclusion. The pathological examination found that the liver tissue was inflammatory, and there were inflammatory cells around the liver door and gallbladder. The liver leaves had a pine or limit necrosis, and the biliary occlusion closure of granulation was formed by latching and neovasal pathogenesis. Studies have found that the liver tissue lesions are similar, and the extent is extent, and the liver and external biliary lanes are mainly based on biliary bile bile and inflammatory disease, and infant hepatitis liver cell necrosis is more prominent. Therefore, it is now considered a biliary blocking possibly possible to be a kind of baby. Acceptable diseases in the pathological process of hepatitis.\\nAfter birth, the biliary blocking is the end of the inflammatory process, and the inflammatory disruption causes the biliary fiber scarification and occlusion, causing the cause of inflammation to be viral infection, such as hepatitis B virus, giant cell virus, etc., may also be a rubella Virus, Hepatitis A virus or herpes virus.\\nSome scholars proposed abnormal factors that are abnormal in the incision of the pancreatic tube may also be the congenital factor in the biliary blocking. In the early days, the disease is congenital bile duct development abnormality, and is related to the development of seminated or disorders in paragraph 4 to 10 weeks in the embryo period. However, the anatomy of a large number of abortion or premature infants biliary system has not found a biliary latitude, reverse recent studies There are more evidence to support this disease. It has been formed in the day. Some patients have normal yellow stools. After a few weeks, the gray white stool and jaundice have also been suggested that these sick biliary obstruction will only happen.\\nAlthough the cause of this disease is much, the end result is a bile excretion pathway obstruction, occurs jaundice, recent studies show that the development of intrahepatic and external tract is two sources, so that the pipelines below the biliary latch, and The case where the licking cavity above the lobular cells is latheled.\\nPathogeneous mechanism:\\nBecause of the biliary obstruction, biliary siltation, the liver is damaged, the early liver can be lightweight, and it can develop into severe bile cirrhosis, the liver is obviously swollen, the texture is hardened, and it is brown green , Is a fine particulate or nodule, and the cut surface can be seen that the microscope, under the microscope, the hepatic leaflets proliferated fibrous tissue strip is deformable, the size is different, the shape is different, the central venous bias or unclear, Hepatic cells are arranged in disorders, expansion or narrowing hepatosis, liver cells have bile calm, showing uniform yellow dyeing, fine particulate or crude granules, all cases can be seen from hepatocyte spoys, hepatocyte swelling, hepatocyte hyperplasia And the culfur cell mobilization is like 2 to 3 months after birth, can be expressed as bile retention, cirrhosis, birth, 5 to 6 months, most small leaflet bile duct disappears, small bile tube arrangement is not neat, Striosis or latching, new bile duct is significantly reduced, almost no gallbladder of bile ducts, liver-out bile duct lock, while external or completely latched, due to different parts and scope of obstruction, biliary latching pathology There are also differences, and the latched biliary tract is organized in combination with inflammatory changes, and there is a small cell infiltrated connective tissue to cover the inner surface covering the granulation tissue, and many circular cells can be seen in the granulation tissue. The gallbladder of the inner cavity may not be seen in the above pathological changes, and the histological structure is normal. Its inner liner is cylindrical epidermis, some scholars have found 2/3 or more biliary latching sickness has giant hepatocytes, similar to neonatal giant cell hepatitis Therefore, it is considered that these two diseases have a close relationship.\\nHitch's change in the vary of liver tissue structure: 1 liver lobular structure change; 2 hepatocellular swelling; 3 chamfered rocking; 4 biliary sputum; 5 fibrosis; 6 bile duct hyperplasia; 7 giant cell transformation; 8 medullary Hematopoietic.

If there is no degradation or residue in the development process, development Repeated malformation of a sugar.\\n(3) The development of the tenderlodes: When the embryo has formed a ridge, there is a bond between the endoderm and the outer embryo, causing the neural tube to the intestinal separation disorder, due to the endoderm being pulled, and the diverticulum-like protrusion occurs, when the endoderm This protrusion is developed into a repeated digestive tract of various forms when developing as the intestine.\\n(4) Vascular said: There have been many scholars in recent years to support this study. After the fetal intestinal development is completed, ischemic infarction lesions occur, resulting in intestinal lock, intestinal stenosis and short intestines. The disadvantaged bowel disconvolution is subjected to nutrients near the vascular vessels, and then it can form intestinal repetition deformity.

The incidence rate can be as high as 6.9%. If the mother has this history, the probability of his child is 19%, and its female is 7%; the father has this history, which is 5.5% and 2.4% respectively, and the study points out the Helicobal stenosis. Genetic mechanism is polygeneic, both non-hidden genetic genetic genetics, but a dominant genetic gene composed of a dominant gene and a sexual modified multi-factor, which works with a certain environmental factor. Such as social class, food type, various seasons, etc.\\n2. Neurological function\\nMainly engaged in the researchers of Helichen Enterus, I found that ganglium cells were formed by 2 to 4 weeks after birth, and therefore, many scholars believe that neural cell development is caused by Helicobial muscle hypertrophy, but denies the past Helber gods. Cell denaturation causes theory of lesions, using histological analysis to determine the activity of Helicobacterium cytoplasm; but there are also different opinions, observing Helicobial narrow ganglobiocytes are not the same, such as gangliocyte development If the poor infants should be more than the full moon, but the two have not been different. In recent years, the structural changes and function of peptide adults may not be one of the main causes, and the ring muscles are observed by immunofluorescence techniques. The number of cerebarrine peptides and vascular active intestinal peptide nerve fibers is significantly reduced, and the determination of the P material content in tissue was used to determine the reduction in tissue in the tissue, thereby speculating the changes of these peptide nerves.\\n3. Gastrointestinal hormone\\nThere was an experiment to taking pent peptide stomatin to pregnant dog. As a result, the proportion of Hao Poles in the raised dog was very high, and the pregnant woman was found to be relatively high at the end of the pregnancy, and the serum stomach has been relatively high at the end of the pregnancy. According to this, pregnant women are Due to the late pregnancy, the serum stomach has increased the serum stomach and enters the fetus through the placenta to enter the fetus. Scholars repeatedly determined gastricin, some reports increased, and some did not abnormally change, even in cases of gastrointestinal, they could not be inferred as the cause of Helicobal stenosis or result, because there were some cases of gastrin after surgery It is restored to normal level, some in turn rise, in recent years, gastrointestinal stimulation, determination of serum and gastric liquid in prostaglandin (E2 and E2A) concentrations, suggesting that the content of the patient's gastric juice is significantly increased, thereby suggesting that the pathogenesis is Helicobacter muscle. The concentration of local hormone concentrations increases the muscles in a continuous tension, while the disease is caused, and some people have studied serum gallbladder profit. There is no abnormality.\\n4. Muscular functional hypertrophic scholars have been meticulously observed, found that some births of 7 to 10 days of infants will cause curd blocks to pass narrow pylorial tubes, thus thinking that this mechanical stimulus can cause mucosal edema thickening, On the one hand, the cerebral cortex has the functional disorders of the internal organs, which makes the pylorus, and the two factors have caused Helicobacter to form a serious obstruction, but there is also a negative opinion. It is believed that Helicobacc has caused the functional hypertrophy of Helicobial muscles. Appropriate, because the muscles of hypertrophic muscles are mainly ring muscles, and the sputum should cause certain prior symptoms, but in cases of certain vomiting, the surgery is often found, the mass is formed, the size of the mass and the length of the disease is not related to the length of the age. When the muscles are so thick to a certain critical value, they also express the obstruction of Helichannel.\\n5. Environmental factors\\nThere is a significant seasonal peak, mainly in spring and autumn, and found that there is white blood cell infiltration around ganglin cells in the tissue sections of biopsy, speculation may be related to viral infection, but detects the blood, feces and throats of their mother The part has not been separated from Koxaci virus, detecting the serum and antibodies have no change, and the pathological changes have been seen with Carka viral infection, and the study continues.\\nThe main pathological changes are Helicobial muscle layer, especially with ring muscle, but also appear to be in the longitudes and elastic fibers, the pylori is olived, and the quality is flexible. When muscle spasm is more hard, general length 2 ~ 2.5cm, diameter 0.5 ~ 1 cm, muscle layer thickness 0.4 ~ 0.6cm, is still larger, but the size is not related to symptomatic severity and longness of the disease, the surface of the lump is covered with peritoneal and very smooth, but due to blood It is affected by the pressure, so the color is pale, and the rings is increased and the endometric fiber is hypertrophic. The muscles are thick, and the hypertrophic squeezed mucosa has a vertical shape, so that the lumen is small, the mucosal edema, and the inflammation will occur. The lumen is more small, and the goblin can only pass the 1 mm probe on the corpse, and the narrow pylorus tube is moved to the gastric sinus. The cavity is gradually width, and the hypertrophy is gradually thinner. There is no precise boundary between the two, but in the duodenal intestinal side boundary, it is obvious because the gastric wall muscle layer and the duodenal muscle layer are continuous, and the hypertrophic mass is suddenly terminated and convexes into the duodenity. Similar seeds, histological examination, historical examination, hyperplasia, hypertrophic, muscle fiber, disorder, mucosal edema, congestion.\\nDue to Helicobal obstruction, near-side stomach expansion, wall thickening, adhesive wrinkles, edema, and retention due to stomach content, often cause mucosa inflammation and erosion, and even ulcers.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nHelicobacter's full layer of muscle hypertrophy, hyperplasia, lacemic fiber, thickening, and muscle tissue, hypertrophic tissue gradually moves to normal gastric wall, on the twelve reflection, due to gastric wall muscle layer The duodenal wall muscle layer does not continue, so the hypertrophy is suddenly terminated in the duodenal entry, so that the hob is spindle-shaped, the length is 2 ~ 3cm, the diameter is 1.5 ~ 2cm, the muscle layer is 0.4 ~ 0.6cm The surface color is pale and smooth, solarky, the mass increases with age, the hypertrophy is pushing the mucosa inward, resulting in a wrinkle, causing the hobial tightness, causing irritation, gastric emptying to enhance the gastrointelation The stomach wall thickening, secondary stomach expansion, on the twelve reflection, due to strong creep, the pylorus part is pushed into the duodenal bowl, so that the duodenal mucosa has a subtrum sample, Helichannel obstruction After the milk retention stimulates the gastric mucosa to produce congestion edema (Figure 1).\",\n",

Emotional factors: Forced feeding, causing children to resent, various factors affecting children\\'s emotions, can lead to anorexia.\\n5, intractable nerve anorexia: Internal secretion examination, intraperination of 17-hydroxy steroid discharge is below normal, plasma cortisol is normal or high, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system is inhibited by dexamethamus, these Changes can also be seen in severe malnutrition, some people may have some spin-neuroendocrine function defects, which are the pathological foundation, and plasma growth hormone is reduced to hypoglycemia, and other malnutrition is normal when neurological anorexia Strengthening, anorexiatica responds to Left-Treasurer, which is closely related to the function of the hypothalamus in the edge system, and some of the authors suspect that the integrated center function of the anti-hermetic appetite is related.',\n",
       " 'Includes environmental factors after birth, after birth, after birth. Some people have reported that there is a \"giant colonity\" due to hypoxia. Hypoxia can occur severe \"selective circulatory obstacles\", changing premature infants\\' immature far-end colorectocyte function. Some people report that surgery can cause giant colon (acquired giant colon).\\nThe study of embryonic studies confirmed that from the 5th week of embryos, the neural tube traine gangliocytes from the neural crest were derived from the fans and the nerve fibers were migrated by the head side. The entire shift process is completed in the 12th week of the embryo. Therefore, there is no ganglionic cytokine due to the development of stopping stops before the 12th week of the embryo, the pause is early, and the intestinal segment of no ganglion is heavily. The rectum and ethyl colon of the tail end are finally evolved by neurotectous cells, so the most common lesion site. Due to the intestinal wall muscle layer and mucosa, the gangliocytes of the gods are completely lack of or reduced, so that the intestinal sections lose their peristalsis, often in a state of sputum, form a functional intestinal obstruction, the heavens and long, the upper stage of the obstruction, the intestine The wall thickens, forming a congenital giant colon. As for the original cause of developmental pauses, it is possible to produce a viral infection or other environmental factors (metabolic disorders, poisoning, etc.) due to viral infection or other environmental factors (metabolic disorders, poisoning, etc.).\\nSome people think that the giant colon genetic factor may have an abnormal chromosome on the 21st1. The giant colon is a polymeric hereditary disease, and there is genetic heterogeneity.\\n1. Changes of pathological and neurommunicative\\nThe accumulated intestines of congenital giant colonity can be seen in a typical change, that is, obvious narrow segments and expansion segments, the stenosis segment is located in the distant end of the expansion section, which is generally located in the junction of the rectal ethyl, within 7 to 10 cm, and the narrow intestinal tube Small, with the expansion of the intestinal diameter, the surface structure has no difference, and the mutant row (i.e., the distal end of the expansion section) is formed in the displacement of the intestinal connection. Creeping, pushing the intestinal contents moving forward, long-term extrusion causes the narrow segment proximal intestinal intestinal tube to expand its funnel shape, and the expanded segment is located in the ethyl colon, and the severe cases can wave, the intestinal is abnormal, its diameter is more normal to increase the diameter ~ 3 times, the maximum can reach 10 cm or more, the intestinal wall is thick, the texture is tough, and the surface of the bowel is lost, it is slightly pale, the colon belt is widened and the muscle pattern is divided, and the columula is disappeared. The intestinal spheres are extremely small, and the intestinal cavity contains a large amount of accumulation, and occasionally touchs the stones, cut the intestinal wall with the original ring muscle, the vertical muscle loss is normal (2.2: 1), and even a proportion of inverted, intestinal wall thickness Two times the narrow segment, the intestinal mucosa edema, bright, congestion and rough, easy to bleeding, sometimes visible with superficial ulcers, the main pathological changes of congenital giant colonity are located in the distal end of the expansion section, narrow velocus muscle The neural ganglin (MEISSNER) is lacking in the gangliocytes in the MEISSNER plexus, it is difficult to find the gangneous plexus, and the neural fiber is thickened. The number is increased, and the arrangement is wavy. Sometimes I find some The ganglion cells are not normal, and the normal ganglus in the near-end colon wall is gradually discovered. The ganglion cells have gradually increased, and the mucosal gland is in different degrees of lesions. The concentrated film is widened, and is accompanied by lymphocytes , Eustomized red blood cells, slurry cells and macrophages infiltrated, sometimes showing superficial ulcers.\\nHD is the development abnormality of ENTERIC NERVOS SYSTEM (ENS) neurvous neurvous neurvous, according to our experiment, its prominent neuropathological change is the intestinal stenosis, and various ENS neurons are missing. (No gangliocytes) or significantly lack of or develop abnormal development (small gangliocytes), intestinal ganglin (Auerbach plexus) and mucous ganglin\\'s neural synaptic network contact also Change, at the same time, the disposal of various types of exogenous nerves has a wide disorder, 1 deputy-intensive cholinergic gangliophageal gangli, threatened, enzymatic activity, enzyme activity, Acetylcholinesterase, Ache) positive nerves (represents cholinergic nerves), with characteristic changes, and related to clinical symptoms (degree of spasm), can be used as an important basis for diagnosis of nakes, 2 wall containing adrenaline (Noradrenaline, NA) After the fluorescent syndrome, the fibers are also increased, complicated, which is characterized by lack of normal gane nerve synaptic network structures around the normal intestinal wall, 3 peptides can be disordered; the walls are missing Neurons; Substance P, SP), Enkephalin, ENK, ENKEPHALIN, ENKEPHALIN, ENK) 增 增 丛 部 部 部 大 大 大 大 大 大 大Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide, VIP, Calcitonin Gene Relected Peptide, CGRP Nerve dry or fiber net, NPY dominance is more obvious, but the four peptides in the mucosa in the mucosa have a significant reduction or deletion, 4 Nitric oxide, no) neurons in gangliocyte colon segments Change, similar to VIP, 5-containing methamine (SEROTON or 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE, 5-T) energy neuron ingredient, in the end of the end of the intestinal muscular plexus of gangliocytes, and the neural fiber bundle network Obviously reduced, the changes in the various neurosums described above, mainly involved in the stenosis of the stenosis of the disease, mainly involving the secretion of the mucosa and the neuronal governance of the mucosa, which may be acetyl-choline, ACH, SP, ENK , CGRP and NPY (excitatory neurotransmitter, stimulating intestinal muscle shrink) and Na, VIP, SOM and NO (inhibitory neurotransmitter, inhibiting intestinal muscle movement) participate in regulating the dynamic function of colon motion dynamic function, becoming a node festival of this disease Neurochemical pathogenesis of cell stenotic intestinal segment shrinkage contraction .\\n2. Pathophysiology\\nThe motion mechanism of colon and internal hornmas is very complicated, and traditional concepts believe that its nerve is supported as sympathetic nerve and deputy-intensive nerves, the former makes smooth muscle inhibition, the relaxation; the latter makes smooth muscle excitement, the contract In contrast, the ganglion in the colon is considered to be a deputy-seniary nervous system. In recent years, the nerve domination of colon and internal sphincters has been learned from the clinical pathology, tissue chemistry, electron microscopy, drug response test, and animal experiments. It has been described above.\\nThe pathological changes of congenital giant colonity are due to the neuroplane cells of the narrow intestine segment (1988), confirmed that there was no connection point for neurological and muscle in the intestinal segment (lack of), and was subject to neurotransmitter When the physical quantitative measurement, it is found that the content of the cholinergic receptor or the adrenal β receptor is significantly reduced by the normal intestine, thereby causing the stenosis and lack of normal peristalsis function to form a functional intestinal obstruction. The secondary intersection of the synaptic linkage associated with gangliocytes should have a large amount of hyperplasia to increase the intestine of the intestinal cytokine. After the sympathetic gods, the fibers are also significantly increased, and a large amount of release acetylcholine is considered to cause intestinal paragraph. One of the reasons, after the lack of cholinergic ganglion cells, the normal segmental movement and rhythmic propulsion peristalsis are blocked, and the inductive nerve from the ankle is directly acting on the intestinal wall muscle cells, thus constituents of the diseased intestinal tube. Strong contraction, but also due to the lack of ganglion cells, if the hyperplasia sympathetic interruption is interrupted, the β-inhibitory receptor cannot affect the choline energy nerve, thereby generating intestinal wall relaxation, but directly reaches the smooth muscle α Excited receptors produce spasm, non-chochicine energy non-adrenerin energy systems in the wall also lack of neurons, and thus lose effective relaxation function, due to rectum, internal sphincter maintains in persistent contraction, resulting in normal promotion of intestines Blocked, finally forming feces retention, bloating, stool can not be discharged, see the normal peristaltic waves of colon can not be separated, not only lack of gangliocytes, especially the number of sympathetic nerves, this is almost It is completely in a state of no nerve domination (Cannon Law), which leads to intestinal atrial contrast, long-term, proximal normal intestinal sections are exhausted, compensatory, secondary expansion hypertrophy, gangliocytes also produce degradation until shrinkage Reduce or disappear.\\nSWENSON put the airbag into the colon, record the peristalsis of the intestine of each segment, and found that the normal pediatage and the soreness are completely different. The former has increased significantly when the intestinal motility enters the ethyl colon; and in the gangli cytotrophone There is no shrinkage wave, this phenomenon when explaining the constipation and obstruction symptoms of children, as the age is increased, the intestinal tube is increasing, and the constipation is in progress, and the intensive disease is more extended. It is to affect the near-end colon or small intestine.\\nThe result of this long-term chronic obstruction will inevitably lead to poor state\\'s appetite, nutrient absorption, growth and development, anemia, low proteinum, etc. The renal function is damaged, and finally died due to low infection or enteritis perforation due to low resistance.',\n",
       " 'This plays an important role in the incidence of acute cholecystitis. Temperature causes obstruction and congenital gallbladder malformation due to stones, parasite, congenital stenosis. Due to gallbladder tube obstruction, a large amount of bile is silly in the gallbladder, and some moisture is absorbed by the capsule wall, causing the bile concentration, the gallbladder concentration is relatively increased, and the gallbladder mucosa is stimulated, causing the chemical inflammation of gallbladder. About 90% of acute gallbladderitis patients are due to gallbladder tube obstruction or gallbladder emptying disorder, gallbladder stones or biliary stacked in the gallbladder neck is an important cause of obstruction, so acute cholecystectitis has stones and non-stones. Split. In children, stone gallbladder inflammation is rare, and there have been significant rising trends in recent years. The cause of non-glyphic cholecystectitis is unclear, which may be caused by a variety of factors. Such as the gallbladder tube is too long, distorted, but the cyst tube lumen is caused by gallbladder or obstruction of gallbladder or throwing caused by gallbladder, mucus, gallbladder. In domestic rural areas, biliary infection caused by biliary tract in the country is one of the important causes of the cause.\\nBacterial intrusion is another important cause of acute gallbladder inflammation. The bacterial invasion is mainly: 1 Invasion of the duodenal intestine, the most common, the most commonly drilled into the bile duct, carrying bacteria enters; 2 passenger intravenous blood into the liver and gallbladder, more common in critical illness Bit; 3 via lymphatic tubes into the liver and gallbladder; 4 passed through arterial blood into the gallbladder to gallbladder, rare. Bile siltation is beneficial to bacterial breeding. The pathogenic bacteria is mainly intestinal bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Amorgacillus, Bacillus, etc., mostly mixed infections.\\nAcute gallbladder inflammation can be combined with acute pancreatitis, which may be abnormal with the pancreatic tube caused by gallbladder to activate the gallbladder. In addition, non-gallstone cholecystitis can occur in severe trauma, burn, large surgery, and long-term fasting and applying TPN, etc., these cases are on the pathogenesis, most of the gallbladder . There are reports that viscous bile and courses can stimulate gallbladder to secrete prostaglandins I2 and E2, which more often mediates inflammatory response. Immunosuppressive children can occur opportunistic microbial infections lead to acute gallbladder inflammation, such as giant cell virus or cocktile infections of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).',\n",
       " \"There are many reasons why small intestine fartas, which can be roughly divided into surgery, damage, disease, and congenitality, most of which are caused by surgery.\\n(1) Surgical surgical surgical for small intestine fistula, Xi'an Medical College Wang Quan adjacent 82 of 82 homotropic fistulas in 1957 ~ 1983 were 95.1% of small intestinal fistula occurred in surgery, Roback and other reports, 55 high-level intestine fistula 1 Examples of Crohn diseases were caused by surgery, the cause of intestinal fistula after surgery was diverse.\\n(1) Gastrointestinal tract hips: It is a common cause of intestinal fistula. Many anastomosis is due to the disadvantages of operational technology, such as excessive differences between the gastrointestinal vertical tube diameters in the anastomosis. It is not uniform enough. There is a larger pore; the anastomosis is consistent or too hard; the anastomosis is insufficient or tensile, the tension is too high; the intestinal wall of the anastomosis, scar or cancer infiltration, etc. Industries or proximal gastrointestinal pressure reduction is also the cause of anastomosis.\\n(2) Twelve: Due to only partial peritoneal cover, the duodenum is easily fistula after anastomosis or suture, and it can be divided into end of the fistula in the residual sewing or intestinal wall cutting sewing. The fistula and the lateral fistula are more severe in the loss of the intestinal fluid, and the prognosis is also poor, and the end fumes have occurred after the stomach resection, or because the residual has a scar tissue, or due to lack of blood, or because the sewing is not properly operated. If there is more tip, the tension is high, and the side fistula is a large portion of the twelve 指 肠, or if there is a slime, there is a slime, and there is a twelve oscillate leak, or Due to excessive seam tension after duodenal front walls, it can be missed in the right renal substation or the right colon surgery.\\n(3) Surgical injury: If abdominal surgery, it is poorly exposed or wide intestinal adhesion, or due to insufficient experience, it can damage the intestinal wall or blood supply, which can cause intestinal fistula, which is particularly widely used in extensive intestinal adhesion. It is most likely to damage the intestinal wall, especially payment.\\n(4) Other foreign matter or drainage, steel suture, etc. after surgery, the steel suture, etc. are placed: most of the abdominal legumes cause the intestinal wear and abdominal abscesses, abscess or self-wearing incision, or form an outer fistula after surgery, abdomen After surgery, the drainage tube is improper (tube is too hard, the catheter is pressed into the intestinal wall) can be oppressed, wear the intestinal wall to form an outer fistula, and the abdominal wall blindly swindled into the drainage tube to avoid damage, in addition to the abdominal cavity The negative pressure of the drainage tube is likely to suck the intestinal wall, causing intestinal wall ischemia necrosis, should be avoided, if necessary, continuous negative pressure attracting, should be used with two-casing drainage, which is best placed in the discharge steel suture In addition to the peritoneal, the steel wire is pressed on the intestinal wall when the intensity is overlapping.\\n(2) The sharp or blunt trauma of the trauma may damage the intestinal tube, especially the twelve reflection of some peritoneal, which is suspected to be squeezed due to fixation, and the intestinal wear is generally entered the free belly cavity. It causes diffuse peritonitis; the rear wall is broken to form a peritoneal abscess, and the free belly cavity can be broken in the future.\\nIt has been reported that acupuncture treatment causes intestinal fistula, and radiation therapy is also likely to damage the intestinal wall and cause fistula.\\n(3) The disease causes the perpendicular acute appendicitis to perforate the appendix surrounding abscess, often forming appendix residual fistula, inflammatory bowel disease such as crohn disease, intestinal tang and intestinal tumors can form intestinal wear and intestinal fistula Inflammatory diseases such as crohn disease and abdominal abscess can result in inner fistula between different intestines, another common internal fistula is a gallbladder or bile duct and intestinal fistula, when cholescence and duodenity occur After sticking, the gallbladder calculus can be compressed by the gallbladder, which is ischemic. After the necrosis, the gallbladder is twelve lystomers. The gallbladder fistula can also pass into the stomach or colon, and the duodenal ulcer can also be combined with gallbladder Or biliary duodenal fistula, acute necrotizing pancreatitis, and then break into the intestines and form intestinal fistula.\\n(4) The congenital abnormal yolk hose is not closed to cause congenital umbilical umbilical intestinal fistula.\\nThe pathological physiology caused by small intestine fistula varies from high and low virators, and it is generally said that the physiological disturbance of high intestinal fistula is a lower fistula, which has roughly the following pathological changes.\\n(1) Differential water and electrolyte, disorderly disordered adult daily gastrointestinal secretion liquid is estimated to be 7000 ~ 10,000 ml, mostly in recent regeneration and colon reception, so the duodenum and jejunum The high small intestine fistula is much lost daily, can be as high as 7000ml, so, if it is not possible to supplement it, it can quickly dehydrate, low blood volume, surround cycle failure, shock.\\nAt the same time, there is still a loss of electrolytes, depending on the portion of the fistula. If the main lost gastric fluid is lost, the loss of the electrolyte is mainly H + and CL. If the loss of intestinal fluid is Na +, K + and HCO3, general small intestine The fistula can lose NaCl2 ~ 40g daily. As the loss of electrolytes will affect the balance of acid 硷, the loss of concentrated intestinal fluid tends to cause metabolic acidosis, such as loss of acid gastric fluids, low potassium poisoning can be produced.\\nLoss of water and electrolytes of low intestinal fistulas, such as the long-regenerative amount of ileum is only 200ml, rarely cause serious physiological disrupt.\\nThe inner fistula between the high small intestine and the colon will have a long section of the intestinal segment of the digestive absorption function, which can produce severe diarrhea, which can also cause severe hydrophilic disorders and nutritional disorders.\\n(2) Infection, small intestine fistula is not healed by the surgery drainage, such as the duodenal or jejuno ostla; further inner fistula is gradually formed by the two cavity organs that have been adherped; These fistulas are not accompanied by obvious local or systemic infections during the formation process, but most intestinal fistulas are confirmed by concurrently or diffuse peritonitis in the formation process, and they have a supa, single or multiple, patients have fever, abdominal pain, bloating, stomach Intestinal dysfunction such as nausea, vomiting, positive, diarrhea or non-exhaustible exhaust, weight loss, poisoning symptoms, or even sepsis, shock, death; cookies should be treated with excorbutive ulcers, gastrointestinal hepatitis, ARDS, Renal failure, etc.\\n(3) Nutrition, as the loss of intestinal fluid does still have a large amount of digestive enzymes and protein loss, digestive absorption function is damaged, so that the negative nitrogen balance, the lack of vitamins, the patient's weight is rapidly reduced, anemia, low proteinmia, and even form evil Liquid is dead.\\n(4) Skin erosion around the fistula, due to the long-time etching of digestive liquid, the skin around the fistula is very easy to occur, the patient is stressful, especially the high intestinal fistula containing rich digestive enzyme, it is more likely to produce skin damage, next to the abdominal fistula The granulation tissue can also be affected by the corrosion of digestive fluid.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\n1. Local damage and general impact after pathophysiological intestine fistula are affected by many factors, the main influencing factors are the high and low sputum position, the amount of flow rate and the smoothness of the drainage, and the body can appear in the body after small intestine fistula. The pathophysiological changes of the series.\\n(1) The disorder of body fluid, electrolyte and acid-base imbalance: Adults have a daily gastrointestinal secretion of 7,000 to 8000ml, most of them are absorbed in the intestine and proximal junction, so the duodenum and jejunum high small intestine fistulaists There are many lost intestinal fluids per day, and it can be as high as thousands of ml. Therefore, if the patient is not allowed to get a timely amount of supplement, significant dehydration and acid-base imbalance performance can result in surrounding circulation and renal failure, Low blood volume shock, or even death.\\nAt the same time, there is still a loss of electrolytes, and the portion of the specific vistor is different. If the main lost gastric fluid is lost, the electrolyte is lost in H + and Cl-, such as the loss of enteric fluid, Na +, K + and HCO3- For many, as the loss of electrolytes inevitably affects acid-base balance, the loss of a large amount of alkaline intestinal fluid causes metabolic acid toxic, such as the main loss of acid gastric fluid to produce low potassium alkali poisoning.\\nThe water of the low intestine fistula is less than the loss of electrolytes. If the distal back to intestinal fistula is only 200ml per day, rarely cause serious physiological disorders, and thus has a small impact on the whole body, and it will maintain a balance after appropriate supplement.\\nThe internal fistula between the high small intestine and the colon makes a long section of the intestinal segment of the digestive absorption function, producing severe diarrhea and water, electrolyte imbalance and nutrient barriers.\\n(2) Infection: After the intestinal fistula occurs, the intestinal contents flow into the abdominal cavity, which often causes acute diffuse peritonitis. If the drainage is not treated, it can lead to poisoning shock, or even died in a short period, such as the position of the fistula. Small, the flow is low, it can first cause limitations of peritonitis. Subsequently developed into abdominal abscesses. After the abscess is performed, the intestinal fistula is formed. If the drain is not timely or not smooth, the infection can continue to be aggravated, and the development is sepsis, which can also be accompanied by sepsis. Exhaust ulcer bleeding, loss of liver function, ARDS, and multi-organ failure, peritonitis and abdominal abscesses are the most important pathological damage in the early stage of intestinal fistula, early discovery and timely and effective drainage is extremely important, and it can be interrupted, and the next treatment Provide advantageous conditions.\\n(3) Nutrition: Due to the loss of a large amount of digestive enzyme in the fistula, not only damage to the intestinal digestive absorption, but also lose a large number of protein, and the patients who often eat in the intestinal fistula can never cause significant negative nitrogen. Balance, there are different degrees of malnutrition, the patient's weight has dropped sharply, anemia, low proteinummia, organ atrophy Changes in a high level of small intestine fistula.\\n(4) Skin erosion around the fistula: Digestible corrosion from the enzyme in the digestive liquid, the skin around the fistula often occurs and different degrees of erosion, the scope is gradually expanded, it is difficult to control and treat, and the pain is very unbearable, low intestine fistula Eczema and dermatitis can also occur around the skin, or a soft tissue infection such as swelling and honeycomb.\\n(5) The pathological changes in the intestinal fistula: the development of intestinal fistula is closely related to the pathological conditions of the intestinal fistula in the locus of the intestinal fistula, in the early, intestinal fistula, more edema and inflammation, It is often accompanied by corresponding power barriers, thus leading to the retention of the intestinal contents and the increase of intestinal pressure, so that the fistula continues, and the fistula has increased, after drainage and anti-infection, etc., the intestinal wall and surroundings The organized inflammation and edema gradually subsided, and the intestinal tendency is restored, and the fistula is reduced. The amount of flow begins to reduce the intestinal fistula, and the granulation tissue has formed a tubular fistula. The final fistula is filled with a granulation tissue and forms a fiber scar. Hea, this is the process of small intestinal fistula by small, after proper treatment, and finally healing.\\nSome of the fistula can not be naturally healed, further surgical treatment, in order to facilitate the guidance of clinical treatment, according to the whole body of intestinal fistula and local pathological changes, the entire pathological process can be divided into three phases:\\nThe first stage: from the occurrence of intestinal fistula, it is stable, generally 2 to 3 weeks, this main contradiction is peritonitis, abdominal abscesses and water, electrolysis imbalance due to loss of large amounts of intestinal fluid, should be targeted in the treatment Several contradictions take active and effective measures to strive to make the condition soon.\\nSecond stage: peritonitis has been controlled, abscess has been drained, the loss of intestinal fluid begins to reduce, the condition is relatively stable, with the extension of the disease, the nutritional problem will be converted to the main contradiction, should reduce the loss of intestinal fluid, supplement nutrition, promotion The reduction of intestinal fistula and wound healing are placed in an important position. If this stage is lasting, other complications can still occur, and even cause patient failure.\\nIn the third stage: the whole body conditions are improved from stable steering, and the body weight begins to increase. The fistula is gradually narrowed with the formation of the granulation tissue, most of the tubular fistula can be closed, and the tubular fistula and lip There is also a condition for surgical repair, and it is necessary to prepare for surgical treatment.\\n2. Classification of intestinal fistula can be carried out from different angles, and the commonly used classifications have the following types:\\n(1) According to the cause of the disease: can be divided into three kinds of injurital, inflammatory and tumitability.\\n(2) Depending on the anatomical part, it is named according to the original portion of the fistula, such as duodenum fistula, jejunami, ileum fistula and colon fistula, etc. Inner intestinal fistula is called high intestine fistula, and the distal returning fistula is called low intestine fistula. This classification is mainly focused on the nature and degree of imbalance of water, electrolyte imbalance, which is easy to guide clinical treatment.\\n(3) Classification according to the intestinal fistula and the skin communication: can be divided into indirectity (also known as complexity) and direct (also known as simple), generally in the originating stage of the fistula The fistula, the intestinal contents are gathered at somewhere of abdominal cavity, and the intestinal fistula is the highest in the patient.\\n(4) According to the shape of the fistula: can be divided into lip fistula and tubular fistula, the former is the top of the intestinal mucosa, and the surrounding of the skin is getting known. This fistile can not be self-healing, the latter is not This classification has certain guiding significance for treatment.\\n(5) According to the side surface of the intestinal fistula, it is also a broken end classification: can be divided into lateral fistula and end fistula, and the loss of intestinal fluid from the side fistula is relatively serious, and the prognosis is also poor.\\n(6) According to the amount of flow out of the fistula in the empty stomach: can be divided into high flow rate and low flow rate, generally referred to as high flow rate intestinal fistula in the 24h inner fistula.\\n(7) According to the number of fistula: can be divided into single-issuance and multiple, these categories are proposed from a side of the side, and the purpose is to estimate the various aspects of the fistula to facilitate clinical treatment. Therefore, after the intestinal fistula occurs, after a stage of emergency treatment, it is necessary to make a qualitative, positioning, and quantitative diagnosis of colon fistula, combined with the above various classifications, making a comprehensive comprehensive judgment in order to better arrange Treatment plan.\",\n",
       " \"(1) Causes of the disease\\nBacterial liver abscess is from intrahepatic hydraulic infection caused by purulent bacteria, also known as suppurative liver abscess, liver due to double blood supply of hepatic artery and portal veins, and through biliary blood supply and mononuclear-macrophages The powerful phagocytosis of the system can kill the intrusion of bacteria and prevent the growth of the bacterial liver, and when the human body resists weak, the invasive suppurative bacteria can cause liver infection to form abscesses, causing bacterial sex The most common pathogenic bacteria for liver abscess is in adults for Escherichia, Amorganism, Copper Green Pseudomonas, in children, is goldenoglococcus, and Streptococcus. Via the following ways:\\nBiliary system\\nThis is the current most important infection path of patients in my country, in cases with biliary obstruction and secondary infection, such as gallbladder tube, biliary troops or Chinese synthetic synthetic diseases, etc. , Infecting the liver to form liver abscess.\\n2. Door vein system\\nAbdominal infection (such as gangreneous appendicitis, suppurative pelvic inflammatory disease, intestinal infection (such as ulcerative enteritis, bacterius, etc.), hemorrhoid infection can cause thrombotic vermicitis of portal vein, and its septic kettlement falls off After entering the liver along the portal system, it has caused liver abscess, and the infection of this pathway is rare due to the wide application of antibiotics.\\n3. The adjacent part of the lipophysphant liver is like a hydrozo lesion such as cholecystitis, the lower abscess and the stomach, duodenal perforation, etc., bacteria can invade the liver via the lymphatic system.\\n4. Blood infection\\nIn vivo, suppurative infections, such as upper respiratory tract infections, acute myelitis, acute endocarditis, 疖 and 痈 and other concurrent hemia, pathogenic bacteria can be entered from liver.\\n5. Direct invasion\\nWhen the liver is open damage, the bacteria can be directly invaded by the wound. Sometimes the closed damage of the liver forms the liver, the original bacteria in the liver can convert hematoma into abscess.\\n6. Other reasons\\nMany liver abscess has no obvious reasons, such as occult liver abscess, there may be some kind of infectious lesion in vivo, when the body's resistance is weakened, accidental bacteramia causes inflammation and abscess of the liver, and reports, incidentally 25% of liver abscess accompanied by diabetes.\\nDue to the broad and effective application of antibiotics in recent years, the progress of bacterial liver abscess caused by other abdominal infections has been rare, and the Beijing Union Hospital compares bacterial liver abscess in the early years and nearly 10 years. Stone and tumors become the most important cause, diabetic patients are prone to this disease (8.3%), and the case of bacterial culture is increased (52.1%). At present, the biliary liver abscess is more than half or more, combined with stones. Or the cancerous biliary obstruction is more likely to happen, and the biliary troops caused by some grassroots units.\\nAs for the so-called unknown causes, it is most likely that the primary blood injury is not obvious from the primary lesion; mild liver damage or ischemia may also be directly incentives, diabetes is also producing bacterial liver abscess The incentive, sometimes the bacterial culture results of liver abscess are negative, and does not exclude that the culture technology is not suitable for the culture technology of anaerobic bacteria.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nBacterial liver abscess is mostly mixed infection, often detecting a variety of bacteria, mainly based on endogenous bacteria, more than 60% of the intestinal Gram-negative bacilli, the most common is the large intestine Escherichia, Near Kreth Bacillus has risen to the first, the most common positive cocci is the important pathogenic bacteria, which is an important pathogen, ausset, and copper pseudocellococci, deformation bacilli, and copper pseudocetransacids. Unestokine can be detected in the pus, the most often separated anaerobic bacteria, the most often separated anaerobic bacteria, the sore bacteria, etc. Bacillus is the main, and pathogens in hepatic vein is mainly used in S. aureus.\\nAfter the bacteria invades the liver, that is, the inflammatory response of the liver, when the body's resistance is strong or after treatment, the inflammation can absorb themselves, and even some small abscess has been formed, it can also absorb the mechanization after effective treatment. Hea, in turn, when the body's resistance is low, the inflammation will further spread, especially in the concentrated portion of the lesion, due to the damage of liver tissue, multiple small abscess can be gradually expanded, and integrated into one or numbers Large abscess, so the liver abscess is mostly single, but it can also be more, in general, blood source infection is often multi-haired, the lesion is mainly due to the right liver or the gallbladder source of liver abscess With a plurality of small abscesses, its distribution is consistent with the distribution of intrahepatic cholangiopathy, on one side of the liver, one leaf or one, is often connected to the bile duct, and the biliary tube is also filled with pus, some people believe that acute obstructive puruge In the late stage of sexual biliary tube, it is essentially a manifestation of acute liver abscess. The abscess and vibrant abscess caused by hematoma infection after hepatic injury, mostly single, due to the rich blood circulation, once the abscess is formed, a large amount The toxins are absorbed, and the presence of severe sepsis in the clinic. When the abscess turns into chronic, the growth and fibrosis of the abscess wall occurs, and the clinical symptoms gradually decrease or disappear. If the liver abscess can be Get appropriate control, can be used in diaphragm, abdominal cavity, chest, liver abscess caused by biliary tract, can also accompany biliary bleeding.\",\n",

The most important of these is a viral infection.\\nInfection\\nContact various infections such as bacteria or viruses in other parts of the body.\\n(1) Virus: such as acute epidemic mumps, rubella viruses, measles viruses, Evi viruses, Koxac viruses, A-type and hepatitis B viruses, giant cytoprirus, etc. More common is the pancreatitis caused by epidemic mumps.\\n(2) Bacterial infection: bacterial infection such as Salmoni causes diseases such as pneumonia, bacteria, tonsilitis, accompanied by acute pancreatitis, mostly caused by bacterial toxins. There are reports in children in children in children and acute pancreatitis.\\n(3) Mycoplasma infection: In addition, mycoplasma infection can also cause acute pancreatitis, and pancreatitis can be the first manifestation of mycoplasma infection.\\n(4) Parasitic infection: insect, hepatoma causes up - infection, obstruction. Many Asia.\\n2. Digestive Disease disease\\nUpper gastrointestinal disease or gallbladder is deformity, bile reflows into the pancreas, causing pancreatitis.\\nCause: An abnormality of congenital pancreatic tubes caused by inclusion of pancreatic or biliary tuning insects, blocking pancreatic discharge. Methods of obstruction in children are. Biliary ispasis in worms.\\n3. Systemic disease\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus, allergic purpura, etc., vascular inflammatory tired and pancreas and other organ blood vessels, causing inflammation of blood vessel wall, necrosis, thrombosis, and caused coastal pancreatitis.\\n4. Trauma\\nThe bluntness of the abdomen is severely caused by the pancreatic duct, and it is easy to injure.\\nFactors of pancreatic tubulating, pancreatic spillation, and retarabishing bjors and infections can lead to acute bleeding necrotic pancreatitis.\\n5. Drugs and toxins\\nSuch pathogenesis is rare in children.\\nReason: Application of large amounts of immunosuppressive drugs, adrenal hormones, morphine, etc.\\n6. Endocrine and metabolic disease\\nSuch pathogenesis is rare in children.\\n(1) malnutrition: low protein diet results in pancreatic fibrosis, atrophy and stones.\\n(2) High blood calcium: by activating the secretion of trypsin, stimulating the secretion of pancreatic enzymes, and the formation of pancreatic tubes.\\n(3) Hyperlipidemia: the effect of triacyyl glycerol, released free fatty acids, acting on the endotheloid of the pancreatic tediatum, causing vascular damage and thrombosis, thereby causing acute pancreatitis.\\n(4) Diabetes: When children's type I diabetes and ketoacidosis, amyloidia occurs due to increased saliva amylase. But with acute pancreatitis is rare.\\n(5) Metabolic diseases: such as maternal matrix, propionate, glycogen accumulation type I, homogenous cystine urine, etc. Its pathogenesis is unknown.\\n7. Hereditary pancreatitis\\nIt is a commonly stained hereditary disease, more common in white.\\nIt is a typical acute pancreatitis in young age, and it will be turned into chronic repeated episodes, and finally gradually leads to calcification, diabetes and fat diarrhea of \\u200b\\u200bthe pancreas.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nPathophysiology of acute pancreatitis is an enzymatic activation in the pancreas to be active as an active digestive enzyme, and at the same time with the pancreatic enzyme to have a hindered into the intestinal cavity.\\nVarious pancreatic enzymes are activated\\nThe pathogenic factors can increase the secretion of pancreatic adenocytes, the pressure of the pancreatic duct is increased, and the pancreatic small tube and pancreatic gland are broken, pancreatic spilled, and contact with the pancreatic and interpretation, At this time, trypsin is original in the pancreatic glue. The intracellular activation is activated as trypsin to penetrate the cytoplasm, leakage into a masony tissue by the base side membrane, producing autodestion, causing pancreatic tissue edema, bleeding or necrosis. At the same time, trypsin simultaneously activates complement and a kini system.\\n(1) Lipase leads to determination of sunserse fat, damaged adipocytes, can produce harmful factors, more severe contrast cell damage.\\n(2) Tart: Activate a variety of pancreatic enzymes to make it active. Further, the bosidase can cause tissue edema, bleeding and necrosis.\\n(3) Phosphatase A:\\n1 Hydrolysis of lecithin in the adenophilic cells, produce free fatty acid (FFA) and lysate lecithin, lysolized lecithin can cause cell membrane to disintegrate, thereby releasing in the cells, causing pancreatic bleeding necrosis and general organ damage .\\n2 Activation leads to damage of the lysosogeneous membrane and the release of lyshase, further causes the activation of the pancreatic dissemination and digestion.\\n(4) Elastic protease: Specific effect is mainly digestive elastic fibers, especially the elastic fibers of the vessel wall, causing pancreatic necrosis, cracking bleeding.\\n(5) Thlormer A2 (TXA2): leads to blood disorders of pancreatic tissue, intra-cytosolic membrane failure and increase in cytoplasmic calcium ions.\\n(6) Klikase:\\nAfter activation of the kinopeptase, it is converted to a klikin. At the same time, the hemachase is broken down into a substance having vascular activity, expanding blood vessels and increasing capillary permeability, which reduces effective circulating blood capacity, resulting in low blood pressure or shock;\\nThe kini is a painful material that can produce severe visceral pain. At the same time, the tissue amine release and white blood cell agglomeration are caused.\\n(7) Current blood vessels can catalyze the kinopeptic origin, and the two cause blood vessel expansion, the permeability of vascular wall increases, leukocyte seepage and pain.\\n(8) lysase: activate trypsogen in adenproplasses. This is a key step in tricks with tricks of pancreatic enzyme itself and pancreas.\\nAttenuation of acute pancreatitis, the secretion of anti-supatient factor is weakened, and the trypsin active complex is aggravated, which causes damage to the body.\\nIn addition: oxygen free radicals can cause macromolecular damage such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and polysaccharides, enabling increased permeability in the pancreatic walls, pancreatic edema, bleeding, tissue denaturation, necrosis, but does not affect the activation of enzymes.\\n2. Endotoxemia\\nThe incidence is very high. It is mainly caused by the leading reasons of lipid polysacies in the cornedoplasty of the intestines, which are the main causes of multiple organ failure and death.\\nIts role is:\\n(1) Directly destroy the lytic membranes within the cellular system of monocytochemical cells, causing cell damage.\\n(2) Non-specifically combined with cell membranes, interfere with the normal function of the cell membrane.\\n(3) Damage the mitochondrial structure, affect the ATP enzyme and the phosphorylation coupling process, which enables energy metabolism.\\n(4) Causes a series of pathological changes in the body, mainly affecting vascular Shuxia, activating vascular active substances, reduces platelets and leukocytes, reduces blood pressure, and DIC and leads to multiple organ failure.\\n(5) Changing the immune function of the body.\\n3. Enzymatic toxic substance\\nIt is a substance that is generated and secreted in the pathogenesis.\\neffect:\\n1 Causes tissue edema, bleeding, necrosis in pancreatic and pancreas.\\n2 The toxins produced with the necrotic tissue can be transferred to the whole body via the lymphatic system and (or) blood circulation, causing complications of the whole body organ to become the main cause of interferous organ damage.\\n(1) Changes in the heart:\\na. Enzymatic substance directly damages myocardial.\\nb. Effective cycle blood volume is insufficient.\\nC. lymphocytes and monocyte phagocytic cells infiltrate myocardium.\\nd. Damaged myocardial cells release intracellular potassium ions to produce local high potassiummia, and affect the occurrence of myocardial demetrification. Abnormal electrocardiogram, but at this time, blood potassium is not necessarily increased.\\ne. Abdominal pain can pass the coronary blood vessels, arrhythmia, etc., cardiogenic shock can occur.\\nf. Trust enzyme into the lymphatic system into the cardiac package causes ceremonial fat necrosis, cardiac inflammation or heartbacter.\\ng. Hypowal calcium has a conduction system affecting myocardium.\\n(2) The mechanism of shock:\\na. Dramatic abdominal pain.\\nb. Vomiting, abdominal and abdominal exudate and other factors can cause effective cycle.\\nc. Myocardial damage.\\nd. Pancreatic, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract.\\ne. Infection poisoning.\\n(3). The mechanism of damage to the respiratory function:\\na. Tissue decomposition product (vascular activator) caused by capillary wall damage of alveolar.\\nb. The phospholipase can reduce the amount of active phospholipid on the alveolar surface to prevent the alveolar inflation to form a lungs.\\nc. Abdominal pain, ascites, abdominal distension, etc. caused limited diaphragmous exercise, and the chest is exudated, affecting the inflation and exchange of the lower leaf druel.\\nd. Trigylglycerol decomposition releases a large amount of free fatty acid to reduce the lung compliance. Common pulmonary pathological changes are: open-ended pulmonary intravenous short-circuit, which destroys the capillary vessels of the pulmonary membrane, and the pulmonary vascular moisture is permeated to form a pulmonary acoustical and alveolar edema. Pulmonary edema, especially edema around the capillary bronch, reduce the amount of pulmonary vent, also affects or limits the inflation, severe edema can cause alveolar to be harmed and difficult to reverse.\",\n",

Disorder of acid-base balance: The normal gastric wall cell can cause water to form carbonic acid with CO2, the latter is dissociated as H + and HCO3-, H + into the adenoy cavity and CL-binding into hydrochloric acid (HCl), HCO3- Circulating, intestinal mucosal epithelium can also produce carbonic acid (H2C03) in an alkaline environment, after dissociation into HCO2- and H +, the former enters the intestinal fluid, the latter back to the blood circulation, HC03- in the blood circulation; HCL in the gastric liquid In the intestine, it is neutralized with HC03-, thereby achieving acid-base balance and H., due to a large number of vomiting, the stomach HCl is lost, so that the above balance is destroyed, the blood in the blood is gradually increased, destroyed (HCO3- ) / (H2CO3) ratio, increase the total amount of blood buffer, pH rise, resulting in metabolic alkali poisoning, such alkali poisoning, more low chlorine and low potassium, called low chlorine low potassium alkali poisoning, The metabolic disorder of obstruction is reduced due to the lack of blood in the blood, and the potassium ions in the distal tubular cells are also reduced, so only hydrogen ions (H +) exchange with sodium ions, the urine H + increases, so that the diapers are acidic. Such metabolic alkali poisoning patients have a contradictory phenomenon of acidic urine, which is also a unique pyloric obstruction, indicating that patients have except for hybridic alkali poisoning, and there is low blood potassium.\\n(2) Partial pathological physiological changes: Helichannel obstruction is gradually formed, that is, gradually increased by some obstruction, in the early stage of obstruction, in order to make the emeralde, the gang is enhanced, the gastrointestinal movement is enhanced Compensatory hypertrophy, but the stomach is not significantly expanded. As the obstruction is constantly aggravated, the stomach has strong peristalsis, it is also difficult to overcome the resistance of Hiphan, the stomach is gradually expanding, the peristalsis is gradually expanding, the peristalsis is weakened, the gastric wall is relaxation, the stomach retention, the stomach is reserved, and it is a bag-shaped expansion.\\nDue to the retention of the stomach content, the Helichen sinus mucosa is stimulated, producing gastrin, which has increased the secretion of gastric wall cells, and the inflammatory changes in gastric mucosa, or even ulcers.',\n",

The shape of the fat sarcoma is irregular, separated by the blade, the realm is clear, there is a package, and there is a grayish yellow, like a fat tunoma; some ash white or brown red, soft like a fish is like a fish, some , Like a translucent shape, soft or partially flexible, mirror underwater tissue tissue has different stages of differentiation of different fatty maternal cells, and the integral of fibrous mucosa is contained in the integral of fibrous mucosa, which occurs in the fat abdominal fat. Fat sarcoma prognosis in the limb.\\nTissilical division of abdominal fat sarcoma includes differentiated fat sarcoma (high differential fat crucibles), mucous fat sarcoma, circular cell fat sarcoma, spherical cell fat sarcoma, polymorphic fat sarcoma and deplified fattzarcoma, which differentiates The fat sarcoma also includes a fatty sarcoid, sclerosis fat sarcoma and inflammatory fat sarcoma, histochemical fat heocoma has an analog adipocyte development from raw leaf cells → fat cells → differentiate better adipocytes It is characterized that most of the peritoneal fat sarcoma is highly divided by lipoprosarcoma, and histological form is mainly composed of nearly mature fat cells, but there is a lipid drip fatty cell and a concise cell. The hardened fat sarcoma is based on the above lesions, and the fibrous tissue hyperplasia and glass samples occur in the tumor; the characteristics of inflammatory fat sarcoma demetallic fattzarcoma have a large number of lymphocytes and sluries in tumor tissue. The cell-based inflammatory cell infiltration.\\nB. Lipoma: Lipoma: Abdominal fat tumor is less more than fat saladous meatarcoma, circular or elliptical, divided into blade, soft, have an envelope, yellowish yellow, its histological characteristics is tumor tissue Composed of mature adipocytes, messenger contains fibrous tissue, vascular and mucus tissue, no fatty tumors that have occurred after fatty maternal cells and peritoneal, when the tumor cells have atypical characteristics, how limited no matter It should be diagnosed with high-division of fat henabarns because such fatty source has a significant recurrence tendency, and the prognosis is poor by long-term follow-up.\\n2 fiber tissue source tumor:\\nA.

       " 'Causes and pathogenesis\\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease\\nObesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, etc. Alone or jointly become the susceptibility factors of NAFLD. The liver is the central organ of the body\\'s lipid metabolism, and intrahepatic fat is mainly derived from food and peripheral fat tissue. Lipids in hepatocytes, especially triglyceride deposition, is a prerequisite for forming NAFLD. The metabolism mechanism that causes lipid deposition is not fully clear, it may be related to the following sections: 1 lipid Accommodation: high-fat diet, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral fat tissue mobilization, promote free fatty acid (FFA) delivery Human liver increases; 2 mitochondrial dysfunction, FFA is reduced in hepatocyte mitochondrial in hepatocellular mitochondrial, converted to triglyceride; 3 hepatocellular synthesis FFA and triglyceride; 4 very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis Insufficient or secretion, resulting in a reduction in liver cells in triglycerides. The above factors cause the synthesis, degradation and secretion of lipid metabolism, resulting in abnormal deposition of lipids in hepatocytes.\\nThe pathophysiological changes formed by NAFLD have proposed \"two blows\": the first hit is mainly insulin resistance, causing a benign liver cell lipid deposition; second hit is mainly oxygen stress and lipid oxidation, It is the key to the progress of the disease. The oxygen compptus state refers to the generation of active oxygen species, ROS and its metabolites, exceeding the dynamic equilibrium disorder between the defense or toxicity, i.e., between the oxides and antioxidants. Various different diseases cause increased oxygen-free group or ROS formation and fatty acid oxidation disorders, resulting in liver cell fat deposition. A large amount of ROS produces a lipid peroxidation reaction, forming a lipid peroxide (1ipid peroxide, LPO), resulting in inflammation, necrotic and fibrosis in fatty liver disease. The incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is closely related to metabolic syndrome, and some believe that this disease is a performance of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome refers to aggregation of a group of diseases (obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, high insulinmia, etc.) with insulin resistance. NAFLD is accompanied by central obesity, type 2 diabetes, and lipid metabolic disorders. Therefore, insulin resistance is considered to be primary causes caused by excessive deposition of lipids in liver.\\nAlcoholic liver disease\\nAfter drinking, ethanol is mainly absorbed in small intestines, of which 90% is in anhenate metabolism, ethanol through ethanol dehydrogenase (ADH), liver microblica ethanol oxidase system (MEOS), and hydrogen peroxide oxidation into acetaldehyde. Ethylene in the blood is mainly converted to acetaldehyde at a low concentration of ADH; when ethanol in blood is in high concentration, MEOS is induced, and the Co-enzyme IIII EshuDPH) and O2 oxidize ethanol Acetaldehyde. The formed acetaldehyde into the microparticles via acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which dehydrogenated into acetic acid, the latter degraded into water and CO2 in peripheral tissues. The oxide co-enzyme I (NAD) transition is reduced by reducing Coenzyme I (NADH) in the process of ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde.\\nThe mechanism of ethanol on liver damage has not fully clarified that the following various mechanisms may be involved in the following mechanisms: 1 僖 僖 嫉 浯 浯 物 高 高 高 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分 分The latter is not only directly damaged by hepatocytes, but also as a new antigen-induced cell and body fluid immune response, leading to an immune response of hepatocytes; 2 谝 谝 即 即 的 过程 过程 过程 过程;;;;; 过程 过程 过程 过程 过程 过程 过程 过程 过程; 过程 过程 过程; 过程;; 过程 过程; 过程 过程 过程 过程 过程;;; 过程 过程;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 过程 过程;垡 垡 赣 赣 e 中 中 生活 生活 即 即 即 即 即 即 过程 即 即 过程 过程 过程 使 使 使 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的 的Disorder may be one of the reasons for hyperlipidemia and fatty liver; 5 Wan ⒀ ⒀ ⒀ 障 碍 碍 低 低 血 血 血 血 血 血 血 血 血 血 血 血 酒 血 血 血 血 浓 酒 酒 精 酒 浓 浓 浓 酒 酒 酒 酒 酒 酒 酒Flow mechanics disorders, decrease in oxygen, and increased alcohol agents, further increased hypoxemia, resulting in deterioration of liver function.\\nIncreasing alcoholic liver diseases: 1 僖 僖 amount and time: In general, an average daily inlet ethanol is more than 10 years will develop into alcoholic cirrhosis, but short-term repeated drinking can take alcoholic hepatitis; 2 谝 谝 易 因 因: It is considered to be closely related to alcoholic liver disease, but the specific genetic label has not been determined.

Leading the prolapse, the muscles of the elderly, during the fertility or during childbirth, can also take the rectum to be prolapsed.\\nLong-term constipation, diarrhea, chronic cough and urination, etc. cause the abdomen internal pressure, which can lead to rectal prolapse, in recent years, research has found that rectal escape often accompanied by spiritual or nervous system disease, the relationship between the two is still unclear Some people think that when the neurological lesions, the function of control and regulating the defecation is obstacted, the rectal chronic expansion, the sensitivity to the stimulation of the manure, thereby producing constipation and controlling the capacity of the defecation, the exceptional force is abnormal, so that the anal pellets and pots The organizational function is weakened and the common cause of rectal prolapse.\\nSurgery causes lumbosacral nerve paralysis, and the anal piraphic piraphic muscle is relaxed, causing rectal mucosa.\\nPathogenesis\\nPathophysiology\\n(1) Maintaining rectal stability: Mass and Rives pointed out that the stability of the rectum is a complex mechanism, and the basic factors of stabilizing the rectum are 3.\\n1 Active support: This is the most important part of the rectal stabilization mechanism, which supports the rectal stabilization power mechanism from the extraalus muscle, Pecamore is described in detail, The anal muscle starts from the front and sidewalls of the pelvis, stopped at the lower end of the oriental organ and the bottom of the spine, but in the front portion of the center line, the triangular rocker, the edge of the triangle, composed of the inner edge of the anusal muscle, constitute this inner side The muscle bundle of the edge is thick, and the rear portion thereof is connected to the rectum. The front is hanging on the shame bow, the rectum and this muscle hoist have extremely strong attachment, due to the rectal longitudes and the anal muscle, between fibers With a wide range of interleaving, it has a considerable area along this intestinal auscular muscle, so it provides a strong attachment and fixing of the basin, and is an important support for anal pins in the stability of the rectum. The muscle, the rectum will take out because it constitutes the inner edge of the pot bottom cleft, and the muscle bundle in which the suspension of the suspension is a shame-proof muscle, and its effect is to lift up the bottom of the rectum, for anal tube rectum Caused an acute angle and oppressed it in front of the tissue structure so that the cracks of the basin were reduced, which not only support the rectum, but also constitutes a more complete and powerful for all organs of the pelvic cavity. The bottom of the background, when the muscle bundle is relaxed, the bottom of the pot decreases, the anal straight intensity is disappeared, the rectum is straight, the rectal cavity is more directly moved to the bottom of the pot, in short, the anal muscle, especially the shame rectal muscle according to it It is constantly adjusted and changing its tension from the above pressure to maintain its support for stabilizing rectum.\\n2 Passive support: This is a variety of connective tissues around the rectum, including peritoneal anti-fold, mesenteric and pelvic membranes attached to bone, vaginal or prostate, some people think this is the main factor in stabilizing rectum, however This is a misunderstanding that the experimental study shows that when the long-term continuous use force, the connective tissue can be blocked. The best examples of clinical practice are women\\'s pregnancy. Due to the long-term pressure increase, the peritoneal white line is long, the postpartum abdomen Stretch marks, more obvious, no denial of these connective tissues around the direct intestine, it is true that the rectum is released, but the rectal prolapse is not as common as stretch marks. It is common to illustrate that the connective tissue is pulled, and the slack does not cause the rectal prolapse, then these connective tissue is fixed to the rectum, and the support is also a secondary position.\\n3 Rugity and location: This means that the normal people\\'s spine and pelvis have a stable effect of the rectum. The tilting of the pelvis and the radiant arc of the spine are removed from the weight of the intraperitoneal organ. This makes the stress force into a multi-direction, thereby alleviating the direct effect of its on the bottom of the basin.\\n(2) Changes in defecation function and ability to control: When the cerebral cortex has been stimulated by pressure changes in the rectal, after the indication of the bowel movement, it is started to shrink by the front abdominal wall and the diaphragm, which is an increase in abdominal pressure. At the same time, the anal pillars were inhibited, pubescent rectal muscle relaxation, pubic rectal strap extended, pelvic bottom decreased, anal vertical corner disappeared, anal tube exquisite muscle was functionally slack together with anal pins as a whole, so that the rectum is relatively compared The vertical position, the intestinal cavity is subject to the pressure from the upper pressure including the pressure of the abdominal cavity and the intestinal cavity and the contraction of the rectal itself, and during the defecation process, the rectum is always attached to the analdui of its bottom. Mainly the support of the shame, and various ligament tissues are fixed in the adjacent structure. At this time, the tension of these ligaments is significantly increased, after the defecation, the shame is rectal muscle shrinkage, and the anal tuning muscle strap will return to the original Support part, which releases tension for all surrounding ligaments.\\nNormal people maintain a sound control dependence on complete sphincter function, keen feel reflection and good storage fever function 3 factors, rectal prolapse is obviously weak, even lost, its mechanism, although it is not completely clear, However, it seems undoubtedly the consequences of long-term, repeated prolapse, because the patient is more uncontrollable obstacles, the most recent study found that the nerve of anal rectal small muscles in histology, PARKS, etc. Pulling the result of injury to the negative and genital nerves, but once there is a bowel incontinence, surgery cannot improve the defecation control function. Therefore, it is important to have early surgery before leaning from incontinence, pay special attention to some patients have no loss before surgery. After surgery, incontinence is caused by the occurrence of the pendulum to mask the emergence of incontinence. After the needle is solved, the incontinence is obvious, so the patient who is serious and long-lasting, it should be vigilant, and Sick and family illustrate the possibility of postoperative incontinence, so as not to cause unnecessary misunderstandings, theoretical anal tension and bowel incontinence are negative, but it is not espularly, so it cannot be judged by anal tension, especially should not think of anal Tension can delay the operation time.\\n2. pathogenesis\\nAt present, there are 4 kinds of pathogenesis on the pathogenesis of rectum.\\n(1) Slipperism said: the rectal prolapse has a common, constant anatomical feature, which is where the rectum is abnormal and deep. As early as MoschoinTG in 1912, this phenomenon has been described, and it considers this in the rectum. The cause is of great significance, proposing rectal prolapse is a slider, a Cul-de-sac diaphragm, a rectal bladder or a rectal uterus, constitutes a hernia, when the abdominal pressure When it increases, the front wall of the rectal is pressed, and the abdominal content is pushed into the rectal cavity, and the anal tube is out of the anal tube, supporting the evidence of this theoretical, when clinical examination, the patient squats down the rectum After the rectal cavity is visible, it is not in the center, indicating that the rectal front wall is more than the back wall, and when the finger rents the intestinal cavity, when the intestines are pinched with the thumb and indicate the intestinal wall, they can feel the two-handed metrics. There are more tissues that can include a decreased rectal peritoneal return, small intestine, and espendicular intestines, not just two-layer intestinal wall, which is currently thinking that this is the most important pathogenesis of rectal.\\n(2) In 1966, PARKS said: It is proposed that the frontal wall of the abdominal wall is usually covered in the anal tube, but does not attack, ie the Flap Valve self-made theory, if due to For some reason, the rectum is not normal, then the further abdominal wall is forced, the pellet floor muscle elastic decreases even disappears, the entire pot bottom decreases due to the shame rectal muscle and the upper portion of the shame, the upper portion of the shame, the upper portion of the shame, and turns into a funnel shape, the lower end rectum The feces is pressed against the funnel-shaped anal region, but the force of the discharge of the feces is the creepy to the colon, push down the feces, push the rectal front wall and open the live flap, and the feces fall into the anal tube to form a strong defecation feel , The abdomen force is pressed into analispesis by the rectal front wall, thereby accelerating the discharge of the feces, and normal emptying rectangular rectangular pelvic bottom muscle contraction causes the rectal lower end wall back, cover above the anal tube, the valve and recovery Turn off the anal canister, which is the reset reflection, and restores anal direct corner, if long, the excessive abdominal wall is pressurized for several years, then the reset reflection effect of the bub is decreased, the rectal wall mucosa is caught The anal canal is not easy to reset, and the nerve end of the tooth is irritated, so that the patient has a more force to step, form a vicious circle, which ultimately makes the clouds continue to decline, and form a Drscending Perineum syndrome, if proceed Stack or prolapse.\\nHowever, it is also believed that the live flap is not large, and the intramuscular reflective pressure is increased, and the pressure barrier is reached, and the pressure barrier is maintained. The front wall is stripped, causing obstructive defecation.\\nIn 1985, SWAS proposed a childbirth of the pelvic nerve injury that can cause the bib of the pelvic. The relevant risk factors have excessive or overweight during childbirth, the second production process is extended, the application of the pliers, especially the tire, most of the maternal injury It can be recovered quickly, and multiple births cannot recover due to repeated damage, resulting in difficulty in defending, repeated meeting and falling pulling the genital nerve to form a vicious circle, which leads to the rectal alapse, ie: vaginal delivery → sphincardine nerve Vecessary → Will Decrease → Refugee Breakstacks → Rectal Level.\\nJohansson and Berman also endors the same disease with the same disease and the rectal prolapse, which may have the following processes: obesity, elderly, childbirth, anal surgery or inflammatory stenosis, etc. Syndrome and closing syndrome → rectal deposition.\\n(3) Intestinal set: Devadhar in 1967, it was considered that the first intestinal mucosa fell, causing rectal expansion, bulk stool, reflectivity, strong rectal muscle system contraction, emphasizing \"key points\" - maximum The feeling of weakens and causes excessive contraction of muscles, which is in a constant presence, and is generally at 5cm under the humerus. The excessive shrinkage force of the rectal muscle system has long concentrated on this, so that the rectal front wall is reached into the columns, gradually Generate a set of stack changes, and finally forms a prolapse.\\nIn 1968, Broden and Snellman devadhar and theuarkauf were respectively injected into the continent in the rectum, sneaked colon, Douglas nest, vaginal and bladder cavity. It was observed with radiographic movie imaging techniques. When the rectum movement, it was found that the prolapse begins, first is the rectal sleeve The starting point of the stack is often at 6 to 8 cm from the anal edge, and the accumulated intestines are not just the front wall of the rectum, but the entire rectal intestinal wall is down, and when the tip is reduced to the lower end of the rectum However, it is detached from an anal, and when the jet portion is completely lowered, the rectal peritoneal return - Douglas nest and the small intestine are taken out by anal, but in the early stage of the prolapse or stack, even if it has been removed from the anus. There is no small intestine, as for why it will cause rectal deposition, there is no exact explanation.\\nDevadha pointed out that the rectal front wall is not more than the back wall, and the intestinal cavity is not biased, it is still in the middle, but when the maximum force is down, the front part of the intestinal wall often takes out more, the intestinal cavity is also Not in the center, there is only a few a few in the rectal tanning patient.\\n(4) Tipymid function, syndrome: 1981 SHAFIK proposed, it believed that due to long-term force, neuropathy or system failure caused pellets, rectal tail bones, crack liga, and tumor suspension, and separated, The muscle sliced \\u200b\\u200band decreased the direct effect of the rectal neck in the intraperitoneal neck, causing all the inner organs to lose the support and its ligaments and relaxed. At this time, if so hard, the muscle contraction before the decline Can open the immediate neck, increased intraperitoneal internal pressure through a wide pilot fracture, further closing the rectux, causing a pullover and proit.\\nButler, MUIR and TODD also pointed out that there is a patient in most rectal prolapse, anal sphincter includes an anal piocarns, even if an early case is no exception, at the same time, in patients with horsetail, it is shown that pelvic surface muscles And anal piraphic sphincter relaxation, but there is no significant evidence in the clinic that the anal across sphincter and potted muscle relaxation is caused by neurological lesions, and PORTER reports can show these muscles in the actuatus and normal people. Different, normal people are rectangular inhibitors in the airbag to expand reflective inhibitory surrounding muscle and anal pilm muscle, as in front of the bowel movement and defecation, this reflective inhibition is obviously prolonged, so It is very likely that the disorder of this sphincter is the pathogenesis of the original, while the muscles relaxation, the deep recess of the deep recess, the hyperactivity of the rectal activities are secondary factors. In fact, the rectal tapping patient can have a normal basin. And sphinclation function, Goligher saw 3 cases of colorectal trip, the anus sphincter and the anal pins were completely normal, Broden and Snellman saw that the rectal prolapse was originally rectal, and started from the bottom of the basin It means that the pelvic substance is not primitive factors, FRY, GRIFFITHS and SMART once again confirmed the initial cause of the rectal prolapse in the photography of these muscles, not the weak potter, and 12 cases in 15 cases in 15 cases. normal.',\n",

The application of broad-spectrum antibiotics causes the intestinal flora.\\n2. Glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive drugs, tumor chemotherapy or radiotherapy, causing damage to the body immune function.\\n3. There are some basic diseases such as chronic liver disease, diabetes, AIDS, etc.\\n4. Intestinal malnutrition and surgical wounds.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nThe pathogenesis of fungi infections is more complicated, and it is not fully understood that the occurrence of infection is the result of pathogenic bacteria interaction with human body.\\n1. Introduction to the body, especially the damage of cellular immune function, the number of phagocytic cells, loss of chemotaxis, decrease in sterilization, etc. It is often the case where there is a patient with basic diseases, and the common situations of these patients are low in immune function.\\n2. In terms of bacteria, alternative alcohol cells contain mannose, enhance its adhesion, and Cantonese alcohol is often bacteria in the tissue, compared with the yeast body, is not easy to be swallowed by macrophages, as well as capsular After the tissue cytoplasm is swallowed by macrophage, it is not easy to be killed, which can breed in macrophages, leading to infection, and the bacteriosis and solura enzyme (trypsin) can cause necrosis around the infection. In addition, the number of fungi in-intake can also become a decision factor in infection, such as Krause once gives healthy people's oral gongu (colony formation unit) whisker, and a few hours of intestinal infection, then Candida blood disease.\\n3. Medical factors such as application of broad-spectrum antibiotics cause intestinal flora disorders, conditions for pathogenic fungi, or intestinal surgery increases infection opportunities.\\nThe pathological changes of fungal enteritis are mainly seen in the fungi invading the intestinal walls, the bacteria, Richococci and a small number of enteritis caused by white candida, and can also violate the underlying and intestinal membranes and small veins. The wall caused fungal vascular inflammation and fungal thrombosis, these lesions are particularly highlighted during the infection of the bacteria, and this disease may also be mixed infected with two fungi, such as white candusachal and bacteria, or white canducer Infection, therefore, when the pathological examination, it is best to combine fungal culture, isolating the pathogenic bacteria, which is conducive to the diagnosis, and the granuloma and fibrous lesions caused by fungal infection, there is a rare intestinal inflammation, the microscope see: The intestinal mucosa has focal necrotic necrosis and ulceration, and the ulcer is shallow. Some deep mucosa under the mucosa, some have a flexible film formation, a pseudo-film has a large number of fungi, fibrin, necrotic tissue and a small amount of inflammatory cell composition All layers of intestinal walls, especially under mucosa, edema, edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, inflammatory cells are different, mainly in neutral granulocytes, and monocytes and lymphocytes, sometimes abscess.\",\n",
       " 'Cause:\\nThin-free hereditary diseases, there have been five diseases in 9 compatriots and a report of 2 consecutive 4 cases of diseases. Modern molecular biology technology also reveals Bartter syndrome to be ion transport protein from the tubular epithelial cells. The genetic mutation has been found that there is a Na-K-2Cl-gene mutation in infant BATTER syndrome, which is located in 15Q12-21, 16 exons, encoding 1099 amino acids, Na-K-2Cl-channel More than 20 mutations have been found, and the classic Bartter integrated coeximation is caused by CICNKB gene mutations, which is located in 1Q38, encoding a CL-passage of a cell substrate containing 687 amino acids, which has been discovered about 20 mutation types, adults The BartTer syndrome is also known as the Batter-Gietlman syndrome, which is caused by a thiazine-sensitive Na-K channel gene (SCI12A3) mutation, which is positioned in 16Q913, encoded 1021 amino acids, and has been found to be up to 40 mutations. There are also some patients found that potassium channel genes (Rowk) mutations, so Batter syndrome can be identified as clinical syndrome caused by the above ion channel gene mutations.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe pathogenesis of the nature has not yet been fully clarified. Some people say 4 false diseases in this syndrome:\\n1. The angioplastic wall of the ATI is defective in defects to renin production and increased secondary aldosterone.\\n2. Large tubulin restraining disorders lead to the negative balance of sodium; low sodium diet is not reversed in renal loss of potassium.\\n3. Prostaglandin is used to generate excess, so that the sodium tube is sodium, and the sodium is reduced to activate the renin-angiotensin system.',\n",

GBS is closely infected with the infection, which can cause serious infection. Its clinical features have been heated. The average is 11 minutes after childbirth. The temperature exceeds 38 ° C, the cold war, the heart rate is fast, the abdomen, the uterus is adverse, the uterus, the uterus or the attachment area, Even with femoral hymmreations, oxygen constitutive bacteria is the main pathogenesis of exogenous infections.\\n(2) Escherichia coli: Escherichia coli and its related Gram-negative bacilli, deformation bacilli, is the main strains of exogenous infections, also of bacteremia and infectious shock most common pathogens, E. coli parasitic in vagina, Yin Yin The urethral mouth is surrounded by rapid proliferation in the puerperium, and E. coli has a significant difference in antibiotics in different environments, and the drug-sensitive test is required.\\n(3) Staphylococcus: The main pathogen is a staphylococcus aureus and epidermis, and the disease is significantly different.

In addition, bispococcus, gonorrococcus can result in a puzzle infection, but less, mycoplasma and chlamydia are also one of the pathogens of the puzzle infection.\\nSource of infection is 2: First, it is auto-infection, normal pregnant women reproductive or other part of parasitic pathogens, which can be caused when infection is induced. The second is a foreign infection, which causes infection after contaminated clothing, utensils, various surgical instruments, items, etc.\\nThe body response to the infringement of the infringement is dependent on the type, quantity, virulence and body defense capabilities. Any factor in the weakening of the maternal reproductive tract and the whole body defense is beneficial to pathogen intrusion and reproduction, such as anemia, malnutrition, chronic disease Near the effect of the expected date of delivery, the premature breakage of the fetus (lysozyme in amniotic fluid has bactericidal effect, when the amniotic fluid loss is lost), amaine cavity infection, various obstetric operation, proactive damage, postpartum bleeding, uterine cavity, Affected foreign matter, labor extension, placental residue, etc., can become the cause of the infection of the puzzle.',\n",

       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nThe cause of polycystic kidney is genetic lack, of which adult polycystic kidneys is often lack of genetic deletion of chromosomes, accidentally deleted from chromosome, which is a dominant genetics of the episode of 100%, so single prince The lack of chromosomes will cause 50% of the children to generate the disease. The infant polycystic kidney is a common-stained hidden inheritance. The genetic changes of the parents have the case of the disease to cause their children, and the probability of onset is 25%.\\nThe evidence related to this disease and genetic has Buck and so on reported an 8 brothers and sisters. One of them is kidney cyst. The father and uncle have died because of uremia. The next generation has 5 people with kidney disease; Brasck, etc. Reporting 1 family 4 generation has found polycystic kidney; REASON has reported that the twins were reported; Crawford reported that 17 people were found in a family of polycystic kidneys.\\nThe disease is 70% to 90% of the bilateral. In 62 cases reported by Lejars, only 3 cases are single side; the ratio of Oickinson reports single side and bilateral ratio is 1: 26; Compared with the normal kidney increased by 2 to 3 times, there have been a double-side polycystic kidney weighing 14436G, Schacht reported 1 cyst kidney 7248g, the outer table of polycystic kidney has an irregular bladder nodule, cut surface See the cavity of countless sizes, there is a honeycomb.\\nInfant (Potter type I) polycystic kidneous sac cavity is a needle size, cyst, and there are few renal tissues. When the cyst increases, the kidney stricken is contrast, so the medullary and cortical development is not complete, and the sac cavity Contains yellow brown mucature, purulent or blood sample liquid, etc. Potter II-type polycystic kidney, most of the left kidney, generally no clinical symptoms, can also have a renal pestinal obstruction or latch, while other two-type renal pelvic and ureteral are often narrow due to being oppressed, but does not block; small leaves The arterial branch also has a significant objection, the capsule wall is composed of cubic epithelial cells, with secretion function, and there are many small arteries, which can cause hematuria due to increased pressure due to pressure.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nThe pathogenesis of this disease is unclear, and Hilde-Brand et al. Believes that polycystic kidney may be expanded from BOWMAN, or it may be expanded from the kidney tube, which is a kidney ball developed by the renal germ, kidney tube. Communication between the aggregation tube developed with Wolffian tube is observed; BialeStack proposes that some cysts are abnormal kidney units, called a giant kidney unit, and believe that some cysts have excretion function; bricker, etc. Liquid in cysts is chemically analyzed to prove that the components are similar to the urine; Norris et al. Considered to be due to many temporary renal kidney units that cannot be normalized, and some kidney units have local narrowing and sections, thereby forming different sizes. Cysts; Hepler, etc., it is considered to be the result of abnormal blood circulation in the kidney, causing the renal substance deformation. Hidd-Brant believes that the secretion department (derived from renal tubes and some kidney tubes) and excretions (origin) Collection tube, pelvis of ureteral buds, lysol, etc.) lose contact with each other during the development period, the secretion department becomes a blind end, and the secretion is not discharged, so that most cysts are formed; if anyone thinks is mechanical factors such as the fetal local inflammation causes excretion tube fiber blocking Due to the inclusion of tubular type and insoluble calcium salts, the result of the urine is not smoothly caused by the expansion of the kidney tube, there are still the following two statements to explain some clinical phenomena:\\n1.Lambert is continuously cut by kidney, and the kidneys with cysts in the kidneys are studied in detail, pointing out three morphology and sources of cysts: 1 glomerular cyst; 2 renal tubular cysts; 3 excretion tube cysts, cyst wall Line is enriched in cubic or flat cells, interstitial fibrous connective tissue, the medullary and cortex is incomplete, normal kidney unit disappear; he found that all cysts and kidneys with kidney tube in the baby The tube is not connected, and there is no function of the cysts of the kidney unit; the adult disease, in addition to the type of cyst, and some cysts are self-functional renal tubules and renal pelvis, and normal kidney tissue between cysts. Rich, and functional activities, so there is no clinical symptom, even in its neighboring renal tissue, it can still be maintained until the cyst is continued, and when the compliance kidney shrinks, the renal dysfunction is caused by the renal dysfunction. Only there is still no appropriate explanation of the cause.\\n2. Dammin believes that the adenoids have excessive adenotube epithelial cells in normal embryo development, and in continuing development, adenot tube epithelial cells generally degrade, digest and disappear, and the initial stage of degradation is completed In section, if the segment is isolated, the cyst is formed, that is, the segmentation expansion formed by the near-end tube in the renal cyst, which is still in communication with the filtrate of the glomerular ball, which is considered to be renal embryo and ureteral buds Instead of connecting, and can explain the phenomenon of polycystic kidneys can have pheasant, spleen, pancreas, and even ovaries, uterus, and bladder.\\nThis disease is generally double-kidney involvement, rare single-side, normal adult single kidney weight of approximately 150g, in invincible adult polycystic kidney patients, the weight of a single polycystic kidney is 256g; in the symptoms of adult polyneps Nephrospheric patients, the weight of a single polycystic kidney is 465g, in an adult polycystic kidney, a common diffuse cyst, no matter the renal cortex and myelosia, a cyst, shape, a bunch of grapes, capsule epithelial cells There are limitations, forming polyp samples, extracellular matrix abnormal hyperplasia, cysts of proximal tubes, cysts are plasma; the cysts formed by distal tubes, sodium in the capsule, low chlorine content, and urea and urea and urea The creatinine concentration is higher, with the symptomatic polycystic kidney patient, with the increase of age, the number of cysts increases, the cyst is increased, the diameter is 2 ~ 3cm, the diameter of the kidney can reach 20 ~ 30cm, the whole kidney is almost caught It contains bloody liquid or blood clots in cysts occupied, common diameter> 3 cm.\\nPolycystic kidney surface shows that cyst consistency is distributed in cortical and medulla, and the renal pelvis is often significantly deformed. In severe cases, it can hardly see obvious residual kidney tissue, but in patients with light symptoms, this disease is often simple and simple. Cysts (such as simple renal cysts, isolated multi-housing cysts) confused.\\nMicroscopic observation can be seen that normal kidney tissue is oppressed adjacent to cysts, on the basis of vascular sclerosis or pyelonephritis, the tube shrinkage, small tube shrinkage and interstitial fibrosis, the identification of the organizational source of cysts is more difficult, unless the cyst is maintained The normal position of the original tissue and the morphological characteristics of epithelials, cysts from the kidney sachets sometimes contain deformable small glomerular platelets; cysts from the deep collecting system are often thin-walled; the assembly system occurred under the package The cyst wall is thicker, and the commonly packaged fiber connective tissue can use a specific plant agglutinin binding test to help identify the tissue of cysts, a collection tube or other.',\n",
       " 'Common causes are:\\na. Acute loss of digestive fluid, such as a large number of vomiting, intestinal fistula, etc .;\\nb. Sports in body fluids, loss in infection zones or soft tissues; such as abdominal infection, intestinal obstruction, burns, etc., the loss of body fluid is substantially similar to the extracellular fluid component.',\n",
       " 'Excessive renal discharge water and sodium, long-term use of diuretics, inhibiting the renal tubules and then absorb sodium.At the same time, the tissue fluid enters the blood circulation, partially compensates for blood volume, and maintains cycle blood.If the dumping salt is too large or continuous salted salt, the water is continuously discharged from the urine, and the extracellular fluid penetration pressure is lowered. The water is transferred from extracellular to the cell, then blood volume and tissue fluid are significantly reduced, and low blood volumeshock.\\nThe loss of gastrointestinal digestive fluid is lost, such as diarrhea, vomiting, digestive fistula, intestinal obstruction, etc.\\nGreat wounds, such as burns, extensive fluids after surgery, the patient is unconscious, the tendon reflexs decreases or disappears, there is a sparrow, and even coma.',\n",
       " 'Causes \\nGenerally, the potassium containing potassium is relatively rich. Therefore, as long as it can eat normally, the body does not cause potassium, digestive tract obstruction, coma, long-lasting patients after surgery, can not eat, if it is not added to these patients intravenous input nutrients Potassium or potassium can cause potassium and low potaemia, however, if insufficient intake is the only reason, the degree of potassium is not very serious because of the potassium-larinated function of the kidney, when potassium When intake is insufficient, the amount of urinary potassium excrement can be reduced to less than 20 mmol / L within 4 to 7 days. It can be reduced to 5 ~ 10mmol / L normally 38 ~ 150mmol / L, .\\n1. Attractive potassium via the gastrointestinal potassium: This is the most important reason for the loss of potassium in children. It is common in severe diarrhea vomiting, which is accompanied by a large amount of digestible liquid loss, and the concentration of K + in the feces in the diarrhea can reach 30 ~ 50mmol / L, this When the potassium loss of manure is more than 10 to 20 times, the increasing potassium content is increased, on the one hand, because the diarrhea is reduced, the potassium absorbs the small intestine, and the other aspect is due to the reduction in blood volume caused by diarrhea. The aldosterone has increased, but the aldosterone can not only increase the discharge of urine, but also enhance the effect of colon secreting potassium, since the amount of potassium containing potassium contains only 5 to 10 mmol / L, so the loss of gastric fluid is not a main reason for potassium. And a large amount of potassium is lost by kidney, because the metabolic alkali poison caused by vomiting can increase renal potassium, and the blood volume caused by vomiting can also promote renal potassium by secondary aldosterone.\\n2, via kidney loss: This is the most important reason why adult loss potassium, which causes common factors in renal potassium.\\n1 Long-term continuous use or excess of diuretics:, for example, inhibit the nearlate small tube sodium, hydrolysis of diuretic carbonic anhydrase enzyme inhibitory acetyl isoxazoline, inhibit myeloid lifting of thick sections CL- and Na + heavy absorption Diuretic pyre urinary, diuretic acid, thiazide, etc., can increase the amount of raw urine flow to the distal kidney tube, and the increase in flow rate is an important reason for promoting increased kidney potassium secretion. The above diuretic can make The amount of Na + reaching the distal tube is increased by Na +-K + exchange, and there is also a common mechanism that causes increased renal potassium induced potassium by Na + -K + exchange. The decrease in aldosterone is increased by the reduction in blood volume. The role of diuretic acid and thiazide is to inhibit the heavy absorption of CL-absorbent rough sections thereby also inhibiting Na + hemorrhage, so that long-term use of these drugs can cause low sodaemia, which can lead to low Chloroemia has proven that olvemia caused by any cause can increase renal potassium, one of its possible mechanisms is that hyploroemia can directly stimulate the latimin function of the distal renal tubule.\\n2 Some kidney diseases: If the distal tubular acidosis is poisoned, the H + -NA + exchange is reduced and the K + -NA + exchange is increased and the proximal renal tubulent acid poisoning is caused by the reducing dysfunction. The retroreal tube HCO3- is reduced, and the HCO3 reaching the distortion small tube is an important reason for the increase in the increase in potassium in the distrail cell, and the acute renal tubular necrosis has a hyperuridine. Increased penetrate diuretic, and the new renal tubule epithelial is insufficient, and there is a increase in potassium induced potassium.\\n3 Adrenal hormones excessive adrenal hormones: When the original and secondary aldehyde isonidant increases, the exchange of kidney distal tubes and the integrated tube Na + -K + exchange, and thus the action of potassium sodium sodium, Cushing syndrome, glucocorticoid cortisol A large amount of secreted increases, the cortisol also has a certain effect, a large amount, long-term cortisol, can also promote the Na +--K + exchange of the distal tubule and the aggregate tube, resulting in increased renal potassium.\\n4 The anion of the unburable absorption in the distal tube increases: HCO3-, SO42-, HPO42-, NO3-, β-hydroxyobutic acid, acetoacetic acid, penicillin, etc., when it is incremented in the distortion tube, due to The negative charge of the original urine cannot be increased, so that K + is easily lost from the tubular epithelial cells.\\n5 magnesium loss: Magnesium deficiency often cause low potaemia, the potassium resistance of myeloplasts relies on Na +-K + -ATR enzymes in renal tubule epithelial cells, and this enzyme is also Mg2 + activation, magnesium, This enzyme may be inactive due to the loss of Mg2 + in the cells, and thus the potassium reliability is disordered, and the potassium, animal experiments also prove that magnesium loss can also cause increase in aldosterone, which may also be the cause of loss of potassium.\\n6 alkali poisoning: When the alkali poison is poisoned, the tubular epithelial cell row H + reduces H + -NA + exchange, so the urinary potassium is increased.\\n3, the skin is lost in the skin: there is only 9 mmol / L of sweat liquid, in general, sweating does not cause low potaemia, but when the heavy body labor is carried out in a high temperature environment, a large amount of sweating can also lead to potassium loss.\\nWhen extracellular potassium is transferred to intracellular, low potaemia can occur, but the total amount of potassium content in the body is not reduced.\\n1. Low potassium periodic paralysis: Extracellular potassium during episodes is a family sexual disease.\\n2, alkali poisoning: intracellular H + moves to extracellular effect, while extracellular K + into cells.\\n3, excess insulin: When the diabetic ketoacidosis is treated with a large dose of insulin, there is two:\\n1 Insulin promotes cells synthesis, glycogen synthesis requires potassium, plasma potassium is induced with glucose into cells.\\n2 Insulin may directly excite the Na +-K + -TP enzyme on the skeletal muscle cell membrane, thereby increasing the intramuscular Na + discharge and extracellular K + into myocytes increase.\\n4, barium poisoning: a large number of \"disease\" cases in Sichuan during the War Period, the clinical manifestations are mainly weakness and paralysis of muscles, and severe people often die due to respiratory muscle paralysis, and to study the disease through Chinese scholars. The reason is barium poisoning, but the mechanism that causes paralysis caused by bismuth poisoning in that time, it has been confirmed that the mechanism caused by strontium poisoning causes hypoxiamia that causes low potaemia, bismuth poisoning, the Na + -K + -ATP enzyme on the cell membrane continues Activity, the potassium in the extracellular fluid is constantly entering the cell, but potassium flowing from the cells is specifically blocked, and thus low potaemia occurs, causing barium poisoning is some cerium salty salty salty acetate. , Barium carbonate, barium chloride, barium hydroxide, barium nitrate, and sulfide, etc..\\nIn the past two or three decades, there is a low blood potassium polio in some of our cotton production regions. It is called \"soft disease\" in some provinces. The clinical main feature is that the thickness of the limbs is extremely weak or relaxed. Severe people often die due to respiratory muscle paralysis, serum potassium concentration is significantly reduced, often there are many people in the same area, have a close relationship with the cause and consumption of crude raw raw oil, and crude cotton oil is a rural small oil plant and squeezed The production process of these plants is not mixed, and the cottonseed has not been sufficiently steamed or even eliminating the shell, and the extracted oil is not allowed to add alkali. So many toxic substances in cottonseed In the oil, the occurrence of \"soft disease\" and subsequent series of studies are cotton phenol gossypol, \"STD\", the mechanism of hypotaemia has not been clarified, \"soft disease\" discovery and subsequent series Research, all of our scholars, so far, abroad, there is no record in the disease.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe physiological function of K has been described above. When the cellopassium incellote is lack of acidosis at the lack of acidosis, if the intracellular K is reduced, K is exchanged with the extracellular H, so that potassium is often accompanied by metabolic acidosis, chronic Potassium can be seen in lack of potassium-deficient nephropathy, which mainly shows that the renal tubule is not complete, and the low blood potassium can also increase the resting potential of myocardial cells. The action potential time is extended. It is reflected in the electrocardiogram. There is a reduction in the electrocardiogram, the T wave vibration is lowered, flat Or inverted, U wave appears and can be fused to T wave, due to the decrease in myocardial cell, the cardiac pacing cells have increased self-discipline, and the myocardial conduction is suppressed, so it is prone to new ectopic excitement, causing various arrhythmia Qi, severe people have ventricular fibrillation and causing death, and a room conduction block can also occur.',\n",
       " 'The exact cause of enuresis is still not fully understood, and it is considered to be related to the following factors:\\nThe family incidence of this disease is very high. Foreign reports, 74% boy and 58% of girls, their parents, or singularly have enuresis, in twins, single egg double brothers, while the diaper is 2 times higher than the double egg double tire, prompting genetics and this There is a certain relationship.\\nThe family has changed, and the long-term suffering from the parents, the night fear is shocked, and the spirit is nervous, and the child can cause the child. Psychological factors can not only re-emergence in children, but also enrolling a few children, gradually forming habits, and some or even adults cannot change.\\nThis is a more common factor. Such children often play more tired before going to bed, sleep very deep, not easy to awake, and most in the dreams of life. If there is more water before going to bed, it is more likely to have a diaper.\\nSome of the bladder of the child suffering from the child is prone to normal children, these children are relatively relatively large, but the amount of urine is not much. This is because there is not much urine in the bladder, it shrinks urination. Some people have used bladder internal pressure measurement methods and bladder B ultrasonic inspection, and found that the bladder capacity of children with enyment is 30% to 50% higher than normal.\\nTo date, although there is no evidence note, there is a clear relationship between the personality of the enuresis and children. However, most children have sex, passive, too sensitive and easy exciting personality. In addition, the acnesia can feel uncharged because of the urination, they don\\'t want others to know, so I don\\'t like more to contact other children, and I don\\'t want to participate in collective activities, and gradually form a shy, inferior, loneliness, introverted personality.\\nParents training is not in place, or often wake up children in the evening, these are all caused fear of urination, which is not conducive to cultivating regular urinary habits.\\nDisease factors: The case caused by the essential diseases is not much. Urinary infection, malformation, and spinal cracking, cerebrospinal film bulging, etc. can cause an enuresis. In addition, asymptomatic urine and high calcium urine can also cause an enuresis to cause people to pay attention.\\nChildren with acryonicity and sleep: After doing sleep ecomminal examination and multi-pruning, it is found in the first one-third of the preamble of sleep. At that time, it was in the middle of the 3-4 period of non-eye-free sleep.\\nThe enuresis can have a series of processes, which begins to be the body is uneasy, the muscle strength increases, the heart is accelerated, the breathing is urgent, the skin resistance is lowered, which is a set of awakening. Correspondingly, a high-band Δ wave distribution occurs on the EEG. After about dozens of seconds or a few minutes, the child was in her sleep. Therefore, it is difficult to wake up the children of the enuresis. Sometimes it is often a child who has pumped the child\\'s bed, replacing the trousers and trousers, he still does not wake up, wait until the morning wakes up, children have completely remembered the urine.\\nThe difference between children with acryonicity and normal people:\\n(1) Because the people in the urine often wake up in the \"wet dream\", if they fell to the river in the dream, they have long thought that the urine is in the dream, in fact, the urine is not in the dream, most of the enuresis Before the urine, the child did not appear to sleep, and most of them were 2 hours after the urine. Only the first time I had a sleep sleep, and normal people had an eye to sleep 4-6 in the eyes, and the enuresis Children in children are on the night of the urine, only 2-3 words of the eye.\\n(2) Many people dream of being able to find the toilet, that is, I have done \"dream of finding the toilet\", wake up anxious, maybe the pants are wet, but most of the urine is still in the bladder No solution. This is because the bladder filling signal is compiled into a dream, and it is a normal person\\'s dream, and children with acryonicity are usually do not do this.',\n",

       " '(1) Causes of the disease:\\nAt present, there are at least two pathogenic microorganisms involved in this disease, namely sand-shaped malavine and urea myramid, and some other microorganisms have also been related to this disease.\\nThis disease may also result in some non-sexually transmitted diseases, bacterial urethritis can be secondary to the superpurer infection, bacterial prostatitis, urethral stenosis, phimosis and urethral intubation, etc., congenital malformation, chemical stimulation , Tumors and certain allergies can also lead to urethritis, systemic diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome may cause urethritis, have no evidence that masturbation, drinking coffee, alcohol, some food, sexual behavior is too small or overflow It will cause urethritis.\\nHistory: Human beings have caused diseases, the ancients have found that the first time from the reproductive tract to the chlamydia is in 1959, Jones, Collier and Smith, they found the sake of the parent of a newborn eye infant Chlamydia, in 1964, the first time from the male urethra with epidemic in parallelism.\\nPathogenic: Sand-eyed primary is the most common pathogens of NGU, followed by mycoplasma, vaginal drops, white candida and herpes simplex virus.\\nAccording to the US CDC, NGU patients, 25% to 55% of cases were caused by Chlamydia: Trochomatis, CT), causing 20% \\u200b\\u200bto 40% of cases from Ureaplasma: Urealyticum, UU), 2% ~ 5% of cases were caused by vaginal drops, and her herpes zoster virus occasionally the cause of NGU, and there were still few cases of cases.\\n1. Chlamydia: Chlamydia is widely parasitic in human, mammals, and birds, only a few pathogenesis, which causes human diseases with sand-shaped malage (c.pneumoniae), Pneumonia, chlamydia (C. psittaci) .\\nSand-eyed zero contained (Biovar) (Biovar) may be different microorganisms, rat and pig subtypes have not found infected humans, and the third is the biomass caused by sex lymph bullum (LGV), namely LGV type, the fourth biometric (sand type) mainly causes reproductive tract infections and sand.\\nSand-eye biological variants can be divided into A ~ K, 12 serum modifications (serovars), A, B, BA, C, and 4 serotypes caused by sand, D ~ K, 8 serotypes cause urinary reproductive system Infect.\\nLGV can be divided into L1, L2, L3, 3 serotypes, causing sexually transmitted lymph bullum.\\nChlamydia generated in intracellular growth, there is a unique development cycle, and two different particle structures can be observed, one is the initial body, reproductive type), circular or oval; another is the original (Elementary Body, infection), with a ball, each development cycle is about 40h.\\nChlamydia is thermally sensitive, 56 ~ 60 ° C can only survive 5 to 10 min, which can be stored in -70 ° C, 0.1% formaldehyde or 0.5% phenol (carbonic acid) can kill the chlamydia in the short term, 75% ethanol in half a minute The chlamydia can be killed.\\n2. Mycoplasma: Mycoplasma is widely distributed in nature, more than 80 kinds of human beings related to human mycoplasma (M.PNeumonie, MP), human mycoplasma (M.hominis, MH), ureaplasma (Ureaplasma) Urealyticum, uu) and reproductive mycoplasma (M.genitalium, Mg), the former causes pneumonia, the latter causes urinary reproductive system infection.\\nMycoplasma is a class of prokaryotic microorganisms that can pass through bacterial filters, no cell walls and precursors, forms, belonging to soft skin branch, is the minimum microorganism that grows in unrequited medium in without life-free medium, mycoplasma size It is 0.2 ~ 2.3μm, rarely exceeded 1.0 μm, and the mycoplasma is propagated by diced, and the morphology is diverse. It is substantially spherical and filamentous. The mycoplasma can grow in the chicken embryo diaper film or cell culture, cultured, nutrition Requires high than bacteria.\\nThe reproductive mycoplasma is a newly discovered mycoplasma. It is divided by Tully et al. From 1981, the urinary tract specimen from two non-gonimic urethritis is separated, and there is a data indicating that reproductive mycoplasma is one of the pathogens of urinary tract and the genital tract infection. Have sex, and the urinary tract and the reproductive tract may be the primary part of the reproductive pillar or infection. Since the reproductive mycoplasm is medium separation culture showed slow growth, the nutrient ingredients needed, so it is very difficult to separate the reproductive mycoplasma from the clinical specimen. At present, the detection of reproductive mycoplasma is mainly passed through the PCR method.\\nMycoplasma is similar to bacteria, but some of the prototype resistance is poor, such as 45 ° C, 15 to 30 min or 55 ° C, 5 to 15 min, is killed, with phenol or to Sueri to kill, mycoplasma After the sugar-free medium, it can be survived for 1 month at 37 ° C, which can be stored for a long time at 37 ° C.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nThe pathogenesis of the chlamydia infection is still unknown, the disease process and clinical manifestation of the chlamydia infection may be the comprehensive impact of the tissue damage and the inflammatory response of the chlamydimuth and the synthetic substance of necrosis of the host cell, causing a large amount of immunization. The reaction (in circulating antibody and cell-mediated reaction), there is evidence that the pick-up body is caused by allergic reactions, or is immunopathological disease, so-called sensitizable antigen, has been identified as HSP60 thermal excitement protein (Heat Shock protens.\\nMost chlamydia infections are only infected with some cells that are relatively small in the accumulated parts. Since each inclusion body releases a large number of living primers each time, the cells nearby infection are relatively small, so there is definitely infectious The control mechanism has not yet known, but the T cell function is very important. It has been found that lymphoid factors have inhibitory effect on the chlamydia, and the chlamydia is sensitive to α, β, gamma interferon. It is more important, γ interfering. Sui may extend the development cycle, so that the mesh has a long time, which may cause persistent hidden infections and can play in immune pathology.\\nThe obvious effect of gamma interferon may be the control of infection instead of the protection of new infections, so it may be related to the removal of infection, and the neutralizing antibody can also function, but the mechanism of the moderate and antibody is also clarified, antibody Can neutralizing cell culture medium infectivity, antibody can inhibit the adhesion of the chlamydia on the surface of non-professional phagocytic cells, or cause the phagocurizoidal fusion, or prevent the formation of the primary and mesh through crosslinking surface protein. Learn to transform.\\nThe mycoplasma does not invade tissue and blood, and can only be adhered to the receptor of the epithelial cell surface of the respiratory and urinary pathogenic tract, and after the adhesion, the cell damage can be further caused by:\\n1. Adhesion to the host cell surface from the cell absorbed nurse, obtaining lipid and cholesterol from the cell membrane, causing cell damage.\\n2. Amgeptoplasma releases toxic metabolites, such as solubolioplasma to produce neurotoxin, causing cell membrane damage; urea with urea enzyme, can hydrolyze urea to produce a large amount of ammonia, to poison the cells, in addition, mycoplasma can also be adhered to red blood cells, After macrophages and sperm surfaces, the urethardia is adhered to the sperm surface, which can hinder the sperm motility, and the neurinease-like substance produced can interfere with the binding of sperm and egg, causing infertility and infertility.\\n(1) The role of chlamydia in the urinary genital tract disease: 35% ~ 50% NGU is caused by sand-shaped glutinous, and the symptomatic urethral infection of sand-shaped jacket is more common than gonococcal urethra infections, as symptoms, light.\\nA sexual acute epididymititis in a sexual abortion, more than 70% of the chlamydia infection, and patients with epipsymitis over 35 years old are generally Gram-negative bacterial infections, and have urinary diseases or instrumental operation history.\\nThe role of sand-shaped primers in non-bacterial prostatitis is still controversial, and it is always necessary to draw a positive conclusion on the role of sand-shaped primers in non-bacterial prostatitis. Further research needs a strict case definition ( Including the number of cells in prostate fluids), using routine histological examination, immunohistochemical examination, serological examination, sensitive molecular inspection techniques (such as PCR or inner DNA hybridization) and treatment of primary body in the treatment of prostate in the treatment Evaluation, etc.\\nReiter syndrome (urethritis, conjunctivitis, arthritis and typical skin mucosa damage) and reactive tendonji or arthritis without other Reiter syndrome, have been found to be related to the genital infection of sand-shaped jam, with trace immunofluorescence (micro- IF) Antibody assay to examine the peer-to-peer syndrome of untreated Typical Reiter syndrome, found 80% or more infected with sand-shaped jaws, Reiter syndrome found more in HLA-B27 haplotypes, Class I HLA-B27 The haplotype can increase the incidence of REITER syndrome by 10 times, and 60% to 70% of HLA-B27 is positive in patients.\\nChlamydia primers can cause brackets and endometritis, like gonococcal, and the chlamydia primers can also cause vestibular gland transport tubes infection.\\nAcute fallopianitis is consistent with the ratio of sand-shaped jackets, which is different from regional and research groups, and Seattle confirmed to laparoscopic inflammation and organized examination of endometritis women to study: 80% ~ 90% All of the clothes or gonococcal infections, the proportion of the boltysum and gonococcus infection is almost equal, and many chlamydimotrous diseases have continued to develop into the lescus scar, resulting in any symptoms or very slightly, so it is called \"Silent: Salpingitis\" is caused by the chloride.\\nSince Fitz-hugh and curtis reported that the Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is reported, the hepatic control simultaneously or after hepatitis is considered to be a combined symptom of gonococcus infection, but nearly 15 years of research reminder: actually the relationship between clothing infection and hepatic disease, may be more close to gonochochrococcus, sexual events, such as there are upper abdominal pain, fever, nausea and vomiting, you should think of hepatic disease Possible.\\n(2) The role of mycoplasma in urinary genital tract disease: The role of mycoplasma in non-laminous urethritis is still arguing, according to the results of culture separation, does not indicate that human mycoplasma may cause non-gonococcal urethritis, for each The clinical reactions of antibacterial drugs do not support this relationship between this mycoplasma and non-gonococcal urethritis.\\nAs for the urealalla, the current data supports the urea primer can cause non-gonococcal urethritis in a few cases. Although it is not clear that there is much proportion of patients to detect that it is indeed caused by urea, from a non-gonococcal urethra The urethra in the urethritis of male patients does not necessarily mean that this is the reason why he is suffering.\\nCompared with the germolithiasis and urealactide, this mycoplasma has a stronger association with acute non-gonococcal urethritis, and 12% to 20% can be detected in the urethra, 12% to 20% of male patients with persistent or acute episodes. Reproductive mycoplasma.\\nStudies have shown that the role of genital\\'s mycoplasma in high chronic prostatitis is extremely small, and the relationship with epididymitis has not been determined, and the role in Reiter disease is not clear.\\nSome evidence shows that human-type mycoplasma may be the cause of female pelvic inflammatory disease, but there is no evidence that the urealalla has a similar role.\\nAccording to reports, urealytic acid can reduce the movement of sperm and reduce the number of sperm, and remove the abnormal appearance of sperm, remove the urea primary body to improve the movement, quantity and appearance of the sperm, although the urea primary may and sperm motility The change is related, but there is no convincing evidence that urealya is an important reason for infertility.\\nMycoplasma and HIV infection and AIDS: In the late 1980s, some researchers in the United States cultured a mycoplasma in organs and tissues of AIDS patients, called MYCOPLASMA Incognitus, and then identified as fermentation Mycoplasma, before this, has been separated from urinary geduced tract to fermentation mycoplasma, but often as contaminants are separated from cell culture, and their pathogen is not unknown. It has been found that mycoplasma enhances HIV in cell culture. Copying can cause cell death.',\n",

Excessive potassium intake is due to the strong potassium potassium and potassium-containing food in the kidney, and it does not produce high potassium presence, and common high potaemia mainly occur in patients with renal function. It is more likely to occur more susceptible to potassium-containing intravenous fluids, and it is statistically about 4% to accept KCL therapy to hyperkalemia.\\n2. Potassium re-distribution in intracellular cells causes changes in potassium and potassium incell and potassium to increase blood potassium, high permeability of hypertension, acidosis, drug devices, and high potassium periodic paralysis.\\nCell damage is seen in cross-ribbed muscle solubility, lactation of tumor cells after chemotherapy and a large amount of hemolysis, etc. Yi, mannitol use and diabetic ketoacidosis are not used in sufficient insulin.\\nMetabolic acidosis, especially those caused by HCl, NH4Cl, etc., can be most likely to induce high potaemia; while organic acids such as β-hydroxyobutic acid or lactic acid occurs less, the difference between the two is mainly for intracellular cells. Different potassium release, the inorganic acid can cause more obvious cell acidification, so that the cell membrane is significantly polarized, more potassium can be released; the dissolution of the organic acid is not as complete, so the influence of membrane polarization is relatively Small, potassium essentials, additional acidosis can stimulate the H +-K + -TP enzymes on the group cells in the group, which can promote K + heavy absorption.

When examination of various instruments or transurethral surgery, bacteria can be brought in vitro, infected with urinary tract, but more common is the intestinal bacteria transurethral tract to the genus , Bladder, ureter to kidney, urinary tract obstruction and urinary flow stagnation, acute pyelonephritis, expansion and effusion in terms of obstruction, and cause pyelonephritis, and pyelonephritis often The negative bacilli is caused by more than 70%, of which the Escherichia is most common, followed by the deformation bacillus, Krepen bacillus, gasifier, copper green pseudomonas, etc .; Gram-positive bacteria account for about 20%, common In recent years, it has been found that there are p-cilia on the surface of the large intestine of Epson strains in recent years. The adhesion is bonded to the urethral epithelial cellular p-cilia's large intestinal Epsum receptor, adhesive to urinary tract epithelials cause acute Pyelonephritis, the adhesion of p-cilia is divided into level I, II, grade III, wherein the strain having a stage II adhesive is closely correlated with pelvic nephritis, only about 30% of blood infection, mostly Staphylococcus infection.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nUrinary tract infections are caused by pathogenesis, and their pathogenesis is associated with pathogen infection, pathogenic fungi intrusion infections are approximately less than.\\n1. Upper infection of about 95% of urinary tract infection, the pathogens is from the urethra, ureter, up to the kidneys, normal conditions, there is a small amount of bacteria at 1 to 2 cm in the upper end of the urethral mouth, only when the body resistance is lowered Or when the urethral mucosa is injured, the bacteria can invade, breed, the rinsing of the urine, IgA in the urine, lysozyme, organic acid, mucosa integrity, and bladder shift epithelial secretion of anti-adhesive factor can resist pathogenic bacteria. Invasion, in recent years, electron microscopy has been confirmed that the surface of the Escherichiae bacteria has many p-bacteria, which can specifically identify and bind to corresponding receptors in the surface of the epithelial cells of the urinary tract, thereby close adhesion of the bacteria on the urinary tract epithelial cells. Avoid being washed away by urine, Escherichiae bacteria (O) antigen, flagella (H) antigen, capsular (K) antigen, polysaccharide K antigen can inhibit phagocytic cell bactericidal activity, directly with them Related to non-pyloriol-bacterioplastic hair and K antigen, it is not easy to stick to the shift epidemic of the bladder, but can be adhered to the squamous epithelial cells of the external genitalia, indwelling catheters, urinary tract, trauma, tumors, prostate hyperplasia, Congenial urinary tract malformation (including ureteral retroform in the bladder wall in the bladder, the bladder ureteral reflux caused by the injection of the sphincter), the neuronal bladder, etc. is a risk factor for upstream infection.\\n2. Hematic infection with blood infection is only 3% of urinary tract infections, the blood flow of the kidney takes 20% to 25%, sepsis, bacteria, bacteria in circulating blood, easy to reach the kidney cortex , Diabetes, polycystic kidney, transplanted kidney, urinary tract obstruction, renal vascular stenosis, analgesic agent or sulfonamide drug application, etc. Increase the vulnerability of renal tissue, common pathogenic bacteria with aureus, Salmonella, fake Single and white candida.\\n3. The opportunity of direct infection is rare, and it has not been confirmed by lymphangine infection.\\n(1) Urinary tract obstruction: urinary tract obstruction caused by various causes, ureteral stones, urethral stenosis, urinary tumors, prostate hypertrophy can cause urine retention, make bacteria easily breed, to produce infection, pregnancy uterine oppression Ureteral, kidney or renal pelvic water, etc. can cause urine excretion but cause disease.\\n(2) Urinary system malformation or function is abnormal: such as renal development, polycystic kidney, sponge kidney, hoof kidney, dual renal pelvis or dual pilot deformity and huge ureteral, etc., the local tissue is reduced to bacterial resistance, bladder urinary tube The reflux makes the urine from the bladder to the renal pelvis, thereby increasing the chance of disease, the neuronal bladder urinary disorder, leads to urinary retention and bacterial infection.\\n(3) Urinary tract intubation and instrument check: catheter, cystoscopy, urinary tract surgery can cause local mucosal damage, bringing pathogenesis of the forperity into the bladder or uprutta, according to statistics, once The incidence of persistent bacteria in diaper is 1% to 2%; indwelling for 4 days, the incidence of persistent bacteria is 90%, and there is a risk of severe pyelonephritis and Gram-negative hypermia.\\n(4) Female urinary tract anatomy physiological characteristics: female urethral length is only 3 ~ 5cm in length, the urinary tract is weak, and the bacterial is easy to rise along the diaper to the bladder. At the same time, the urethral mouth is close to the anus, and provides conditions for bacterial invading urethra, urethra The surrounding local stimulus, the vulva vulva vulva is susceptible to bacterial pollution, vaginitis, cervicitis and other gynecological diseases, sex hormones during pregnancy, postpartum and sexual life, can cause vaginal and urethral mucosa to make disease invasion, Therefore, the incidence of female urinary tract infections is higher than that of men 8 to 10 times.\\n(5) The body's resistance is reduced: systemic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic diarrhea, long-term use of adrenal corticosteroids, decrease the body's resistance, and the incidence of urinary tract infections has increased significantly.\\n4. Bacterial virulence factor urinary tract infection is mostly caused by a single strain, such as the Escherichiae, which accounts for most of urinary tract infections, which can cause bacteriurus from irritable bacteria to cystitis and all pyelonephritis. Escherichia, which invaded the urinary tract, is more than just the most popular fungus, and they have some special strains, these strains have various virulence characteristics, they can shuttle in the intestine, continuous in the vagina , Then up, invading the normal urinary tract, which is more likely to occur in urinary traces, Vur or obstruction, more likely to occur.\\nThe antigen of Escherichiae is an O antigen (semi-antigen or cell surface antigen), H antigen (flaunting antigen) and K antigen (membrane antigen), seminology-free serological types related to symptomatic bacteria and strains from symptoms Different, in this way, 8 of 8 (O1, O2, O4, O5, O7, O16, O1, O2, O4, O5, O7, O16, O1, O2, O4, O5, O7, O16, O18 and O75) of different o antigens accounted for 80% of pyelonephritis caused by this strain. A little K antigen (K1, K2, K5, K12 and K13 or K51) were separated in 70% of pyelonephritis. In contrast, the H antigen did not appear to be associated with poisoning alone, may not be the colorectal Epsum The O antigen itself causes pathogenicity of the urinary tract of these large intestine Epson strains, exactly, determining the gene of the O antigen structure and genetically connected to the pathogenicity of these bacterial strains.\\nIn summary, the mechanism of urinary tract infection is a fairly complex process, summarizing the following steps;\\n(1) Bacterial colonies with P-bacillia are surrounded around the intestines and urethraes and spread to the urethra.\\n(2) Through the turbulence of urine in the ureter, bacteria is up to the kidney, such as inflammation, no timely control, then renal tissue damage, ultimately fibrosis.\\n(3) Through the urine reflux, bacteria are retrograde and combined with the corresponding receptor of the epithelial cells of the urinary tract, local reproduction causes kidney inflammation, and infected kidneys can stimulate the anti-renal tissue antigen autoimmune response, resulting in There is no continuous existence of kidney damage during continuous proliferation of bacteria.\\nDamage of renal tubule during acute pyelonephritis can release small tube antigen into blood circulation, induce antibody-mediated small tube interstitial disease, but several studies have not proved anti-kidney antibodies in patients or animal serum in bacterial pyelonephritis, and experiments Type-synthetic IgG and IgM during immunophysis, and the immunofluorescence microscope is observed in the animal or human pyelonephritis, and the immunofluorescence microscope is observed (suggesting immune complex type small tube disease), but also wireless deposition ( It is suggested that the anti-medium-tube base membrane disease), but Losse found antibodies directly anti-E. coli in experimental rabbits, which can also react with antigen from the liver and nephritis, antibody The guided autoimmune response is a controversial topic that pyelonephritis is limited to one side of the kidney often leads to its complete obstruction, and the opposite kidney is normal, which occurs in a single obstruction, and the experimental animals have repeatedly proved this. point.\\n5.

Sometimes renal ischemia and nephrotoxic factors can exist. .\\n(1) Acute renal ischemic renal ischemia is the most common type of ATN, which is due to the continuing role and development of the aforementioned kidney precedent, causing a long time of renal ischemia, hypoxia, causing ATN, chest, abdomen In operation, a large amount of bleeding or blood transfusion after surgery, various reasons for shock and shock correction, in vitro circulation heart returns, the same kidney transplant restoration of renal blood circulation and heart recovery, etc., there is a condition of kidney ischemia and reperfusion, so it is generally said It is a long time for ischemic emergency renal failure than other types of ATN, and the time required for renal function recovery is also longer.\\n(2) Acute nephrotoxic damage of nephrotoxicity is mainly exogenous nephrotoxicity, such as drugs, heavy metals and chemical poisons and biological vents.\\n1. The current incidence of drug nephropoxicity has increased trend, which accounted for 11% of total renal decline rate and 17.1% of internal medicine disease due to emergency renal failure, causing common drugs of ATN to amino sugar antibiotics such as Milliflorin Sunerin, kaatin and butamycin, polymyxin B, textamycin, sulfonamides, bimmyxin, cyclosporin A, and Shupa.\\n2. Toxic nephropoxic damage\\n(1) Heavy metallic renal poisons: such as mercury, cadmium, arsenic, uranium, chromium, lithium, bismuth, lead and platinum, etc .;\\n(2) Industrial poisons: such as cyanide, carbon tetrachloride, methanol, toluene, vinyl alcohol and chloroform;\\n(3) Sterilizing disinfectant: such as cresol, amphibular phenol, formaldehyde, etc .;\\n⑷ Insecticide and herbicides: such as organophos, phosphorus, etc., such poison poisoning should pay attention to early taking the measures to remove drugs in vivo.\\n3. Biological toxins have blue-fish, snake bite, poisonous, bee, etc. Each major organ function.\\n4. Contrast renal damage original renal impairment, diabetes, elderly patients, blood volume, hyperuricemia and multiple myeloma, etc., acute renal dysfunction occurred.\\n(3) Infectious diseases such as epidemic hemorrhage, hook-end spiral disease, etc., which is most common in the presence of hemorrhagic, accounting for 18.6% of patients with total renal failure and 29% of internal medicine, and the pathological foundation of hemorrhagic heat is The whole body taber hemorrhagic damage, the heavy duty mortality rate should emphasize early diagnosis and early implementation of dialysis treatment.\\n(4) a shaped blood transfusion of acute hemolysis and intravascular hemolysis, red blood cell destruction caused by various in vitro circulation, immunological disease causes hemolytic anemia crisis, various causes of hemoglobinur, malaria epidemic, malignant malaria And antimalarial drugs such as primazoline and Quinning, etc., extrusion, trauma and non-invasive ribbed muscle cleavage caused a large number of myoglobin deposited renal tubes, causing kidney damage to hemolysis.\\n[Pathogenesis]\\nThe pathogenesis of acute renal tubule necrosis is the main factors of multi-link, renal blood flow mechanics change and acute renal tubule damage, etc.\\n(1) Renal blood flow mechanics change renal blood flow dynamics change in early ATN, and is often initial factors. When hemorrhagic shock or severe blood volume is insufficient, due to the adjustment of nerve and body fluid, body blood Re-allocation, renal artery contraction, renal blood flow can be significantly reduced, renal perfusion pressure reduction and glomerular injection small arteries are obviously contracted, causing renal cortical ischemia and ATN, sometimes in the early bleeding of acute ischemic ATN early Although the blood volume is quickly supplemented, the rate of renal blood is recovered, but the glomerular filtration rate, GFR is still not recovered, indicating that there is an early renal blood dynamics change and renal blood flow distribution, these renal blood The pathophysiological basis of abnormal flow mechanics is related to the following factors.\\n1. The role of renal nerve is widely distributed in renal vascular and glomerular body, and adrenalin can cause renal vascular contraction, resulting in renal blood flow and GFR, and stimulates kidney nerve when ischemic ATN. The degree of renal vascular contraction is far more than the stimulation of normal animals, indicating that the sensitivity of the blood vessels on the renal nerve stimulation is increased by the ATN, but such an enhanced reaction can be inhibited by calcium channel blockers, suggesting the kidney in which kidney appears in renal nerve stimulation Vascular contraction is related to renal blood-heated cellular cellular activity, but clinically observed kidneys without neuropouruce, such as the use of varying renal transplantation recovery of ischemic ATN incidence of ischemic ATN as high as 30%, and does not support The leading role in the occurrence of renal nerves in ATN.\\n2. Renin-angiotensin in renal tissue, a complete renin-angiotensin system in the kidney tissue, ischemic ATN, renal blood circulation diameter change more than renal tissue-angiotensin systems Activation, resulting in strong contraction of the ballotherapy, but inhibits renin activity and antagonist angiotensin II can still occur, indicating that the renin-angiotensin system is not an ATN decisive factor.\\n3. The effect of intraperitrene in renal prostaglandin, especially prostate cycloalkin PGI2, in renal cortical synthesis, significantly expanded blood vessels, which increases renal blood flow and GFR, and is advantageous sodium and anti-neuttine hormone to the collection tube The rehabilitation effect of water, which has been significantly reduced in the blood and renal tissue in the blood and renal tissue during ATN; it has been shown to prevent ischemic ATN, and prostaglandin antagonist anti-inflammatory pain Accelerated ischemic kidney damage, in addition to kidney ischemia, renal cortex synthesis thrombus increased, and kidney blood vessel contraction, but there is currently no evidence that prostaglandins come to dominate in ATN.\\n4. Endothelial cell source contraction and diastolic factor in ATN have been used for many years, many scholars emphasize the pathological secretion of vascular endogenous contraction factor and vascular endogenous diastolic factors such as nitric oxide (NO) release disorders to ATN blood flow Dynamics changes, they found that ATN's early renal blood flow is reduced, not due to the effect of renin-angiotensin, but ratcaine, hypoxia, vascular endothelial cells release more endothelin (experiment It is found that low concentration of endothelin can make the renal blood vessels and continuous contraction, and the renal vascular resistance increases, causing GFR to drop or stop, glomerular capillary and measuring cells, the true small blood vessel has high-intensive endothelin receptors, experimental Continuous injection of endothelin in the renal blood vessel can also cause a significant shrinkage of renal blood vessels), the latter causes the renal injection and the episode of the episode, and the increase in the gas vessel resistance is more obvious, so the renal blood flow and GFR Parallel decline, but sometimes the patient's serum endothelin concentration increased more than ten times, there is no ATN, and the normal blood vessel internal skin can still release diastolic factor, synergistically regulate blood flow to maintain blood circulation, increase blood flow to the kidney, reduce the ballistics The role of the spherical arterial resistance, the release of ATN early blood vessel endospermity factor is obstacted, the ischemia / reperfusion, oxygen free radicals also affect the release of diastolic factors, in which case the renal blood flow mechanics change may be more prominent At present, endothelial cell shrinkage and diastolic factor adjustment imbalance may play an important role in the occurrence and development of certain types of ATN.\\n5. The blood stasis of renalominity is observed in the ischemic ATN model. The nephride outer district and cortical interior are damaged the most obvious, and the degree of renal medullary blood stasis is obviously related to the level of ATN damage. Oxygen first affects blood supply for raised crude renal tubular cells. Since the rough branches are a high energy consumption area, sensitive to hypoxia is abnormal, hypoxia cells are reduced to the active heavy absorption of sodium chloride, and rise Crude segment injury allows TH glycoproteins to be easily deposited in a thick section, causing distal small lumen blocked and lumen extravascular overflow, so that ischemic ATN is also an important pathogenesis.\\n(2) Renal ischemic-propylene infusion cell injury mechanism renal tissue restores blood supply in acute ischemic, lack of oxygen, after the shock correction A large amount of oxygen free radicals, and the energy decomposition of hypoxia is more than synthesis, and triphosphate decomposition product hypoxanthine aggregates, producing a large amount of xanthine under xanthine oxidase, and then produces increased oxygen free radicals, and renal tissue cell membrane contains lipid substances. Such as multivalent unsaturated fatty acids, the latter is highly affinity, producing a variety of lipid peroxides, which can cause multiple durable unsaturated fatty acids on the cell membrane to disorder, resulting in a variety of prapacuys on the cell membrane Fatty acids and protein ratio disorders, causing cell membrane fluid fluidity and permeability to change, thereby reducing dysfunction, various enzyme activity, increased capillary permeability, exudation, increased cells, interstitial edema, etc. The cell membrane enters the cell membrane to enter the cells, enhance the intracellular calcium ion, and the cell death, in addition, the cortical mitochondrial function is significantly reduced, and the adenosine synthesis of triphosphate is reduced, allowing the cell membrane to depend on thiosphate energy The transport function is lowered, the intracellular calcium ion accumulation, the latter, and the mitochondria increases the increase in the intake of calcium ions, and the calcium content in the mitochondrial is too high and the cell death is caused by calcium ion antagonists. occur.\\n(3) Acute renal tubule damage, severe extrusion injury and acute toxicity poisoning, such as CHH pathological changes caused by mercury chloride, arsenic, and acute damage such as necrotic cells and necrotic edema and dielectric edema. The glomerular and renal vascular changes are relatively light or lack of, indicating that the primary pathogenesis of ATN is due to the reduction or stop of renal tubule caused GFR or stop, 1975 Thurar et al. GFR decreased due to acute damage caused by renal tubules The tube-small ball feedback mechanism, and many scholars in recent years also propose an important role in the adhesion factors and polypeptide growth factors of renal tubular epithelial cells in ATN, development and renal tubule repair.\\n1. Tube obstruction can directly damage the tubule epithelial cells, and the lesion is uniformly distributed, the neutral tube is mainly, necrotic epithelial cells and peeling epithelial cells and microveremis, cytotenis or hemoglobin, Anturogin or the like, causing an increase in pressure in the proximal small lumen of the obstructive portion, which increases the pressure in the glomerular balloon, when the latter pressure and colloid osmotic pressure are close or equal to the glomerular capillary At the time of pressing, the glomerular filtration was stopped, and the experiment proved that renal ischemia or nephrotoxicity caused subhydrawal renal tubular damage, mainly manifested as the proximal tubular brush deficiency, cell swelling and air expansion, and renal tubes. The epithelial cell (TEC) is detached from the base film, so that there is a defect / exiting area on the renal tubular base film, but most of the TEC is completely intact and has survival, and there is also a rabbit ischemic and a poisoned kidney damage model. The number of TEC in the liquid is also significantly increased. Description ATN, TEC will fall off, and a considerable number of TEC did not die. The study showed that TEC was detached from the base membrane, which was due to changes in adhesion of renal tubular cells. Kidney tube The epithelial cell adhesive molecular family has the greatest impact on the ATN, and the integrin can mediate the adhesion of cells and cells and matrices, and maintain the integrity of the renal tube structure, and cell adhesion in TEC injury. Changes in:\\n1 Cell skeleton changes, especially the adhesion of TEC and cells, cells and matrices, and changes in cell skeleton, resulting in TEC, resulting in TEC, resulting in falling off the TEC .\\n2 Changes of integrin, ischemia-reperfusion injury can cause significant integrated weight distribution abnormalities, especially in small tube structures unshabited area, small tube epithelial loss of integrity, suggesting reperfusion can cause cell adhesion to change , The excessive expression of integrity in the surface of damage cells may increase the adhesion of cells in the small lumen and cells to promote the formation of cell gates of the blocking small lumen.\\n3 Changes of matrix proteins, 1991 Lin and Walker report experimental animal clamp kidneys after 30-40 minutes, immunofluorescence semi quantitative analysis visible mucin has a degree of loss, ischemic injury 3 to 4 days cortex and skin The increase in mucin protein in the medullary junction, the adhesive protein and fiber linker began to increase in 1 to 2 days after ischemia, and the 5th day, the Type IV collagen has no change, these studies have shown ischemic injury. The significant changes in the early biomass ingredients, these changes will affect the adhesion of TEC, which may be related to TEC's falling and damaged repair, in summary, research on TEC adhesion in TEC adhesion and disease is still In the primary stage, once these effects have been clarified, it will will have a significant impact on the research on the pathogenesis of ATN. The understanding of epithelial silent mechanisms helps to fundamentally explore methods of preventing falling and reinforcing repairs, maintaining epithelial system functions. Integrity, reduce pathological damage.\\n2. Returning to the leakage, necrosis, falling off, the renal tube wall occurs and the renal tube wall, the small tube cavity can be directly connected to the kidney interstitial, resulting in a small lumen medium urine to diffuse into the kidney Inc. causes renal interstitial edema, oppressing kidney units, plus weight of kidney, making GFR more reduced, but Donohoe et al. To observe only in experimental ATN, only in severe renal tube necrosis, there is a renal tubular stock solution with leakage phenomenon, other Experiments also prove that renal blood flow and GFR decline can be removed by renal tubular liquid, indicating that the latter is not an initial factor of ATN, but the degree of renal interstitial edema is seriously an important factor in the development of disease.\\n3. Tube - ball feedback mechanism ischemia, nephrotoxicity and other factors cause acute renal tubular damage, resulting in a significant reduction in sodium, chlorine, and chlorine, sodium chlorine, chlorine in the tube cavity, caused by distal small tubes The induction of the palliocar arterial secretion renin, the increase in blood vessels I, II increases the injection of the ball and renal vascular contraction, the increase in renal vascular resistance, GFR has declined, in addition, the bone tube blood is significantly reduced, The renal prostate cycline is released to the cortex, and the renal blood flow is further reduced by GFR.\\n4. Diffissed blood vessels (DIC) sepsis, severe infection, epidemic hemorrhage, shock, postpartum bleeding, pancreatitis and burn caused ATN, often diffuse microvascular damage, platelets and fibrin deposited in damaged kidney The intravascular membrane, causing vascular obstruction or blood flow, red blood cells flow through damaged blood vessels, resulting in a microvascular hemolysis, platelet aggregation increases and blood vessel shrinkage may still be prostate due to kidney ischemia Receive a reduction in the ring, the above various causes are often susceptible to the coagulation pathway and inhibit fibrin dissolution, resulting in microvascular thrombosis, generally believed that the DIC is a critical condition, which can be used as an ATN, but can also appear in the ATN disease progression It can cause or increase bilateral renal necrosis, rare DICs in ATN without complicated, so DIC cannot be used as a general pathogenesis of ATN.\\nThe research on the pathogenesis of ATN has made great progress in the 1980s, but it is still difficult to explain all the phenomena of ATN, which may have different types of disease, different kidney disease pathological damage, may have its common initial mechanism and sustainable development factors, and Every school is interconnected and interlaced. At present, there is a deep understanding and understanding of the political agents of the ATN pathogenesis, and there is a positive guiding significance for early prevention and control.\",\n",

Gradually forming a fibrous crescent body, and the number and severity of the formation of the new moon is closely related. As for the principle of the formation of the new moon, it is not very clear. It is considered to be fibrin through the lesion of the nephrol. The vascular wall exudes into the kidney holocycope, stimulates epithelial cell reactive proliferation, but can cause such a significant degree of epithelial cell proliferation, which is likely to have other unknown influencing factors, macrophages have It is emphasized that macrophages promote fibrin to proliferate with glomerular deposition, macrophages on the wall of the balloon, and transformed into epithelial cells, forming a new moon, and the crescent can disappear.\\nIn the glomerular capillary plexus with the new moon, there is a stove necrosis, and the capillary atrophy collapse, and the cyst is blocked with the new moon bonding, and finally the entire glomeruli can have glass samples or fibrosis. In addition, the glomerular capillary plexus can also be seen in proliferative changes.\\nThis pathological change is except that the glomerulus is protruding, and there may be cell infiltration, edema and fibrosis in the interstitial, and the degree of interstitial lesions also affect the preparation.\\n(II) The main visible immune complex in immunofluorescence examination is a particulate deposition and an anti-base primer antibody to deposit two types, and immunofluorescence is a linear deposit.

Therefore, the immune complex is considered to be the cause of blood vessels and kidney damage.\\n2 Other immune responses: After the EHF virus invades the human body, it can cause a series of immune responses in the body, and currently discover:\\nA. Early specific IgG antibodies in this disease increased, and its rising level was positively correlated with the positive rate of fatty cell degrees, suggesting a type I metamorphosis.\\nThere is an immunochonde in the platelet in patients with EHF, electron microscopy to observe the renal tissue except for granular IgG, and the renal tubular base membrane presence linear IgG deposition, suggests that the reduction in clinical platelets and the damage of the renal tubule are related to the type II metamorphosis.\\nC. Electron microscopy found that lymphocytes attacked renal tubular epithelial cells, which showed that the virus can be mediated by the mediated damage of the cytotoxic T cells, suggesting the IV metamorphosis reaction, as for the I, II and IV metamorphosis reactions of the above presence in this disease The status in the pathogenesis is still waiting for further study.\\n(3) Effect of various cytokines and media: Hantan virus can induce macrophages and lymphocytes of the body, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), TH1 cytokine IFN-R, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), TH2 cytokine IL-10, etc., causing clinical symptoms and tissue damage, such as IL-1 and TNF can cause fever, a certain amount of TNF can cause Shock and organ failure, in addition, plasma endothelioliolysin, alleviation, etc., raises increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, promoting renal failure.\\n2. The pathological changes of pathology and physiological diseases are most evident in small blood vessels and kidney disease, followed by organs such as heart, liver, brain.\\nEHF basic morpology is small blood vessels (including small arteries, small veins and capillaries) endothelial cell swelling, denaturation and necrosis, and tube walls are irregular contraction and expansion. Finally, the cellulose sample is dying and disintegrating, and there can be slightly in the lumen Thrombosis, due to extensive small vascular lesions and plasma extulsor, the surrounding tissue edema and bleeding, the kidney naked eye can be seen, hemorrhage, bleeding, renal cortex is ischemic, and the renal medulla is extremely congested and has hemorrhagic and edema. It can be seen that glomerular hyperplastic, base film thickening, renal profile tubular degeneration and renal tubule are compressed, the nephrospheric cell infiltration, electron microscopy, glomerular capillary endothelial cells have varying degrees of swelling Individual glomerular necrosis, tubular neoplasm and platelets, endothelial cells and platelets, endothelial cells and platelets with low electron densities, mainly in cavity Extensive bleeding under the membrane, myocardial fiber has different degrees of denaturation, necrosis, partial breakage, adenproprope, bleeding and solidification necrosis, neuroprants have no significant change.\\n(1) Shock: The disease in the 3rd to 7th day of this disease, hypotension shock is called primary shock, and the shock, which occurred after the less urine, is called secondary shock, and the cause of primary shock is mainly due to systemic blood vessels. Widely damaged, vascular permeability increase, plasma exotic infiltration in loose tissue, such as peritoneal and inactor soft tissue, reduce blood capacity, due to plasma extraction, blood viscosity increase can promote dispersion The occurrence of blood circulation (DIC) causes blood circulation, blood flow is blocked, thereby further reducing effective blood volume, and the cause of secondary shock is mainly bleeding, secondary infection and multiuri and electrolyte supplementation, resulting in effective The blood volume is insufficient.\\n(2) Bleeding: EHF patients have more complicated factors, sometimes a variety of factors involved, generally believed that the skin of the skin, the mucosa, the small out of the mucous membrane is capillary damage, the platelet reduction and the platelet function is caused, and the low blood pressure shock period is too much In the early stage of urine, the DIC is the abnormality of the coagulation mechanism, and the reduction in platelet reduction and dysfunction, heparin substances increase and uremia can lead to bleeding.\\n1 Small blood tube injury: The lesion of small blood vessels in patients with EH is mainly manifested in endothelial cell swelling and degenerative, and severe people have fibrotein necrosis, and even vascular wall disintegration can lead to a large number of blood exudate and bleeding. At present, small blood vessels There are three reasons for damage:\\nA. Haman virus directly acts on vascular endothelial cells to impair it.\\nB. Haman virus antigens and antibody complexes are depressed in small blood vessels, and the neutral granulocyte phagocytic antibody complex is attracted under complement, and the proteolytic enzyme in the lysosomes is released, thereby damaging endothelial cells.\\nC. Due to the microcirculation disorder caused by shock and other reasons, vascular endothelial cells are deficient and cause denaturation necrosis.\\n2 platelet reduction and dysfunction: Under normal conditions, platelets are arranged along the blood vessel wall, which has the effect of maintaining capillary integrity, reducing capillary crispy and permeability, and the reduction in platelets leads to increased capillary crispy and permeability. In addition, due to the obstacleness of platelet adhesion, agglomeration and release function, the platelet reduction of blood is reduced by platelet reduction in patients with EHF is related to the mature disorders of bone marrow mega, and the increase in disorders of platelet consumption and destruction.\\n3 Exceptions of the coagulation mechanism: Since the DIC has consumed a large number of coagulation factors, the DIC causes the secondary fiberous fiberous energy, and the fibrinogen degradation product increases, and the increase in heparin material can cause blood coagulation.\\nA.DIC reasons: EHF patients can reach 35% to 70%, in addition to the restoration period, especially in low blood pressure shock and less urine, this is an EHF virus or immune complex Capillary or small blood vessel endothelial cells are damaged, resulting in exposure of vascular base film collagen, thereby activating factors, resulting in endogenous coagulation, in addition to plasma extraction, blood concentration and viscosity, and shock The acid poisoning during the small period of urine has the effect of promoting DIC.\\nB. Heparin substances increased: 80% of patients with EHF started the increase in heparin substances from the heating period, except for the release of hypertrophy in the body, due to the decrease in heparin in the liver damage, renal failure reduced heparin excretion and plasma A large amount of protein is reduced to heparin in a large amount of heparin, which promotes the increase of free heparin.\\n(3) Acute renal failure: whose reasons include:\\n1 renal blood flow barrier: due to plasma extraction, blood volume decreases and blood concentration, blood flow is insufficient, so that the rate of glomerular filtration has dropped sharply.\\n2 immune injury in the kidney: The deposition of the immune complex of the glomerular base membrane and the renal tubular base membrane has been confirmed, and the cell toxic T cell can be damaged after activating complement. Causes the renal tubule damage.\\n3 interstitial edema and bleeding: plasma extract caused by renal edema, as well as renaloid congestion, bleeding oppression of the renal tubule, can reduce the amount of urine.\\n4 kidney ischemic necrosis hypotension shock and DIC lead to renal vascular micron thrombosis, can cause renal substance cells to produce ischemic necrosis.\\n5 activation of renin, angiotensin II: shrinking renal artery, thus reducing renal blood flow, and the rate of glomerular filtration decreased.\\n6 renal tubular cavity: the renal tube lumen can be blocked by the protein, tube type, and the urine is discharged.',\n",
       " \"The occurrence of SLE is related to genetic factors, and the incidence of family is as high as 3% ~ 12%, and there is a significant family aggregation tendency. After a wide study of the HLA of the SLE patient, the gene-related gene associated with the SLE is mainly at certain locus of HLA, especially in the HLA DR region, and the HLA expression type is multi-whic properties. Studies have confirmed that there is a haplotype HLA B8 / DR2 in the population, which is more likely to produce cells and body fluids hypermurmur immune responses; this may be due to the polymorphism of T and B lymphocytes and antigens in cells HLA encoding, manifestation It is to inhibit the low cell function, and its own antibody and globulin are increased. Some people now think that SLE is susceptible to different structures of the T cell antigen receptor. Recent studies have found that some of the polypeptide structures of the T cell B chain appear simultaneously in the same individual in the same individual, and increase the likelihood of SLE. In addition, SLE is still a variety of complement defects, such as C2, C1Q, C1R, C1S, C4, C5, C8, and BF, TNF, and C1 esterase inhibitory factors. These complement ingredients or genetic defects can affect the fill tradition-activated pathway, increasing the sensitivity of the body's infection factor and the sensibility of SLE.\\nSLE is mainly involved in women. The prevalence of women in childbearing age is 9 ~ 13 times higher than the peer male, but the preamble of women before the pre-periods and menus is only slightly higher than men. Therefore, estrogen is related to SLE. Regardless of male or female SLE patients, the level of 16α-hydroxyfluidiculid and estroethyrin is significantly increased. Female contraceptives can sometimes also induce wolf sore syndrome. The human body and animal experiments have proven that estrogen can increase B cells to produce antibodies against DNA, while androgens can inhibit such reactions, and recently, SLE patients have risen, leading the secondary changes of sex hormones. Further research confirmed.\\nCommon people are chronic virus infections, and there is a tube mesh incident in the tissue of SLE patients under electron microscope, similar to the nuclear tubular structure of the sub-sticky virus, but further research is that this is a non-specificity of a cell damage. Performance. Some people also found a substance similar to inclusion bodies from the SLE patient. However, from the tissue containing the inclusive samples, the virus has not been separated, so these substances are to be confirmed. Among the SLE patients, there are a variety of high titers of antibody antibodies such as anti-measles, antibiotic antibodies, anti-EB viruses, anti-fluid mumps, anti-EB viruses. In patients, there are antibodies such as DS-DNA, DSRNA, and RNA-DNA and other anti-transcribed viruses. It is also proposed that the onset of SLE is closely related to the C-RNA virus. In general, many signs indicate that viral infection may be one of the ever of SLE, but it has not been confirmed that viral infection is abnormalized with SLE patients and autoimmune. In addition, some people think that SLE's onset is related to tuberculosis or streptococcal infection.\\nA variety of drugs are related to SLE disease, but the pathogenic mechanism is different.\\n1 induced SLE symptoms of Penicillin, sulfonamides, Bautai Song, gold preparations. Such drugs enter the body, first causing allergies, then excited lupus quality or causes potential SLE patients to abverse, or aggravating the Slewers, stopping drugs cannot stop the disease.\\n2 The drug that causes lupus syndrome with hydrazine, propacenine, chlorpromazine, phenytoin, isoniazid, propyl and methionide or the like. After a large dose of such drugs, the patient can change the clinical symptoms and laboratory changes in patients, but the pathogenesis has not yet been clear. Some people think that chlorpromazine is combined with soluble nuclear protein after ultraviolet irradiation to enhance its immunity, hydrazine rack and soluble protein, which can enhance the immunogenicity of their own tissue components. Such patients can subside or residual a few symptoms after stopping the drug. As new drugs continue to appear, some people think that drugs can be used as an exogenous carrier to determine clustering with host tissue, induce autoantibodies. Therefore, the clinical use of drugs should pay attention to the occurrence of drug lupus.\\nAbout 1/3 SLE patients can induce skin damage, ultraviolet wire can induce skin damage or cause a few cases, and can induce or increase systemic lesions. Normal human skin tissue can occur after the ultraviolet irradiation, forming a thymidine dimer, and removes the ultraviolet irradiation, can repair the polymerization. SLE patients have a defective defect of diimenic DNA, and excessive thymine dimer may become a pathogenic antigen. It is also believed that ultraviolet irradiation allows skin cells to be damaged, and the nuclear factor can enter intracellular, effect with nuclear nucleus, and produce skin damage. In addition, X-ray irradiation, cold, strong electro-light irradiation can also be induced or aggravated SLE condition.\\nFood containing psoralen, such as celery, fig, European windproof, etc., has a potential effect of enhancing the photosensitive sensitivity of SLE patients; mushrooms, smoked foods, food dyes and tobacco, etc., etc. The seeds, sprouts and other pods of L-knife ukins can also induce lupus. The intake of limiting heat and fatty acid can reduce the severity of rats, and it is speculated that this will be beneficial to SLE patients.\\nAsbestos, silica, chlorinated ethylene and hair dye containing reactive aromatic amines may be related to SLE. Serious physiology, psychological stress can induce SLE's sudden attack.\",\n",

There is a so-called \"physiological streptococci\", which is generally 12-type 12-type, other as 1, 4, 18, 25, 41, 49, etc., and 2, 49, 55, 57, 60, often associated with pus and glomerulonephritis, and whether acute glomerulonephritis and the degree of lesions are infected with streptococcal infections. Non-weight, suffering from the human immunes of M protein, the immunization of M protein, has a constant, permanent and protectiveness of M protein, and rarely on the disease.\\nPathogency:\\nAt present, the immune response after the infection of the disease is caused by the following reasons.\\n1. Acute glomerulonephritis after streptococcal infection generally does not occur in the peak of Streptococcus infection, and 1 week or 2 to 3 weeks after the attack, it is in line with the general immune response.\\n2. The serum total complement concentration (CH50) can be significantly reduced in the early stage of acute glomerulonephritis, and each complex value can be measured, and the concentration has a decrease in the concentration, but thereafter C3 and C5 are more obvious, indicating that there is immunization. The reaction is present, and the complement may be activated by two pathways of classics and bypass, and the blood circulation immune complex is often positive.\\n3. The Fluorescence Antibody Law, which has been found in the glomerular measuring cell and the glomerular base membrane antigen, observed between glomerular base membrane and epithelial cells under electron microscopy. The block hump sample exists, including immunized complexes and complements, patients with glomerular IgG and C3 are granules, patients with complement calibration, polymorphic white cells and monocytes in the patient\\'s glomerular ball, indicating this The three types of inflammatory mediators further promote the development of lesions, and macrophage proliferation plays an important role in the development of lesions.',\n",

The arthritic animal model manufactured by mycoplasm is similar to the human RA, but does not produce a rheumatoid factor (RF) unique to human RA. It has never found bacteria in the articular liquid and synovial tissue of RA patients. Or bacterial antigen, suggesting that bacteria may be related to the attack of RA.\\nRA and viruses, especially the relationship between EB viruses is one of the attention of scholars at home and abroad. Studies have shown that articulitis caused by EB virus infection is different from RA, and RA patients have strong reactivity to EB virus than normal people. The RA patient serum and the synoviramine antibody antigen antibody occurred in the serum antigenic antibody, but the EB virus nuclear antigen or housing antigen antibody is not found in the serum of RA patients.\\nIn some families, the incidence in certain families is high in the crowd.

       " 'The excitation of the IgE-mediated immune response is due to allergen-sensitive T cells and specific allergen contact release promoting interleukin IL-4, IL-5, which promotes IgE production and activated fertilizer large cells. Alkaline cells, edible cells of IgE, basophilic cells release blood-activated proteins (such as histamine) and chemokines (such as IL-4), causing blood vessel spasm, prostaglandin synthesis, Platemondrangular coagulation, thrombosis and fibrin are calm, in several kidney inflammatory diseases, can have IgE deposition and infiltration of eosinophils, especially alterations caused by penicillin (especially methoxyenycin) Sexual tubular interstitial kidney disease is attributed to IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, which is accompanied by eosinophilic cells, intake of eosinophilic cells and IgE deposition, effective treatment of corticosteroids, often deactivated Sexually improved after sexic drugs.\\nThe kidney damage is due to linear deposition of IV collagen-specific antibody in GBM, and the antibody is combined with the corresponding antigen to form an immunogenic complex activation complement system, which is a set of enzyme activity, chemical-inducers, binding, and regulatory properties. Plasma and membrane protein, the complement can be activated by C1 (classic pathway) or C3 (alternative pathway) to form a protein, referred to as a membrane attack (MAC), which is composed of complement components C5-9, MAC on tissue Damage, directly through the membrane passage, can also attract other inflammatory cells to participate in the immune response, such as complement fragment C5-7 to attract neutrophils into the inflammatory site, neutral granulocytes can release lysosomes, further cause tissue damage, and Can directly damage and penetrate GBM, and can also generate reactive oxygen substances (ie, free radicals, superoxides), type 20 yields, and can activate coagulation systems with platelets, stimulate fibrin deposition, so In anti-renal bulb base membrane disease, the cytotoxic antibody is linearly deposited along GBM. Although the complement is more irregular, there is an intermittent, but it is also approximately linear distribution, histopathological characteristics is the necrosis of the glomerular structure, there is Fibrin deposition fiber epithelial crescent formation.\\nAnti-neutral granulocyte cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) can also cause cytotoxic antibodies mediated immunotropic kidney disease, plays a role in Wegener glomerulonephritis and other vascular inflammatory kidney disease, although there is no immunization in immunogenic examination The deposition of the component is an oluntary immune, preferably in the scope of ANCA-related kidney disease into immunogenic kidney disease, because ANCA has made it, although there are different types of ANCA, each Identify a special neutral granulocyte cytoplasmic component (such as myeloid oxygenase, lunosase, elastase, protease 3, lactoferrin, tissue B, D, g), but most of the ANCA-containing plasma only Specificity is targeted against an antigen, in practice, all C-ANCAs are only specific to the protease 3, while P-ANCA is targeted by myelotated oxide enzyme. WeGener granuloma is prototype of ANCA-mediated kidney disease, almost all disease cases Related to ANCA.\\nThe starting factors generated by ANCA are not known, but the interaction of ANCA and neutrophil cytoplasm antigens have been considered to activate neutrophils, and cell surface integrins are up - regulated, and neutralized cells and make it along the kidneys or During vascular inflammation, other patient vascular endothelial cells are rolled, and neutral granulocytes adhere to endothelial cells increase the ligand of endothelial cell surface interact, there is intracellular adhesion molecule-1, endothelial-white blood cell adhesion molecule 1, these ligands enhance the binding between activated neutral granulocytes and endothelial cells, resulting in a variety of immune inflammatory reactions, such as the formation of reactive oxygen species, lysosomes, T cell activation and release lymphatic Factor, causing damage to endothelial cells.\\nGlomeropathic vessel endothelial cells are particularly impaired, although rarely have deposition of immunoglobulin, but has proposed hypermondyl antigens of protease 3, it is proposing an autogen of ANCA and protease 3 or myeloxide enzyme.

Urethral mucosa wound caused by urethral instruments, can destroy urethral mucosa defense function, resulting in bacterial infections.\\nSuch as stenosis, urethral stenosis, urethral narrow urethral valve, urethral tumor, female film utrophache, hymeni in the urethra, etc.\\nSince the foreign body or urethra, the stones in the urethra, the pause can cause urethral infection.\\nSuch as prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, vaginitis or cervitis can spread to the urethra, which is often a stubborn lesion of chronic hypitis.\\nUnchecked life is easy to cause urethral infections.\\nPathogenesis\\nInfection routes have up-sex infections and downward infections, depending on the pathogenic bacteria.\\n1. Non-specific urethritis, pathogenic bacteria is the most common in Escherichia, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus.\\n2, specific urethritis, also known as gonorrheal urethritis, referritted to gonorrhea, pathogenic bacteria.\\n3, non-gonococcal urethritis, pathogenic bacteria, ureta malavine, lypelimoline, bloodthirstone bacteria, fungi, vaginal drippers, sharp warts and herpes simplex viruses.\\nWhen urethral acute inflammation, the urethral exterior is red and swollen, the edges are peripheed, and the surface of the mucosa is often bonded by slurry or purulent secretions. Sometimes there is a superficial ulcer, viscous edema under the mirror, including white blood cells, slurry cells and lymphocytes infiltration The capillaries are obviously expanded, and the hypertrophy gland is congested or fill in pus cells.\\nChronic urethritis is mainly in the rear urinary tract, bladder neck and bladder triangle, sometimes spreading the entire urethra, the surface of the urethral mucosa has a dark red granular shape, due to scar contraction, the outer mouth of the urethra is normal, and the lymphocyte, pulp is visible under the mirror.

       " 'Accidents of 1/3 ~ 1/2. Usually in children, few (<20%) accompanied by pituitary leaves. This diagnosis can only be determined if it is carefully looking for secondary reasons. When there is a pituitary front leaf functional reduction or high ulirinemia or a radiological examination with a butterfly or butterfly sitting on the disease evidence, it should be found as much as possible, and the longer follow-up factors cannot be found. The diagnosis of primary diabetes is definitely affirmed. It has been reported that the primary diabetes patients have been on the nucleus, and the neurons of the indoor neurons are reduced, and the antibodies of the hypothalamic neuronus are present in the cycle.\\nAparticles happen to hypothalamus or pituitary new organisms, including: surrogate cytoplasmic tumor, craniopharyngeal tumor, embryonic toroma, pineigangoma, glioma, meningioma, metastatic tumor, leukemia, tissue cytopathy, class Strobarcoma, yellow tumor, nodular disease, and brain infectious diseases (tuberculosis, syphilis, vascular lesions).\\nHereditary diabetes is very small, can be a single hereditary defect, or part of DidMoad syndrome (can be manifested as diabetes, diabetes, visual nerve shrink, deafness, but also known as Wolfram syndrome).\\nIt is common in the brain, especially the surgery, the hypothalamus site, is a severe brain injury.\\nPathogenesis\\n1, physiology of blood vessel\\n(1) AVP synthesis and metabolism\\nThe blood vessel pressure is composed in the lower-looking knot, and the original product is the primary product, which enters the golgus to form a hormone original, the latter being wrapped in the neurocrine vesicles, vesicles along the neuropropic body The bundle axis motivates to neuroplast, producing active nine peptides by enzyme during the persuasion, ie arginine vasopressin, AVP and a molecular weight (neurophysin) and a 39 amino acid composition. Glycal peptides, these three products are released into peripheral blood, and the AVP is secreted by hypothalamic neurons, and it is stored in neural pituitary, in recent years, AVP fibers have been found in the outer side of the positive mid-ridge. AVP can also secrete into the pituitary generic system, at the bottom of the third ventricle and the brain stem of blood vessels.\\nAVP combines with a renal distortion tube, a set tube endothelial cell, promotes water from the lumen stream, helping to maintain the constant osmotic pressure and body fluid capacity, and the AVP is very low in plasma, and blood-free active effect, but High concentration AVP acts on V1 receptors can cause blood vessel contraction, and may participate in the learning and memory of AVP in brain axons, and the AVP fibers that are piloted can be related to promoting ACTH release.\\nThe AVP concentration in plasma and urine can be measured by immunoassay. When the liquid is inserted at will, the neuroprant contains near 6 units or 18 mmol (20 μg) AVP, the peripheral blood Avp concentration is 2.3 to 7.4 pmol / L (2.5 ~ 8 ng / L), the AVP concentration in the blood changes at night, the night and early morning, the lowest in the afternoon, when normal water, healthy people release AVP23 ~ 1400pmol (400 ~ 1500 ng) from the brain plit, from the urine AVP23 ~ 80pmol (25 ~ 90 ng), after 24 to 48 hours of water, the release of AVP increased by 3 to 5 times, the level of blood and urine continued to increase, AVP mainly inactivated, nearly 7% ~ 10% AVP in activity The form is discharged from urine.\\n(2) Adjustment of AVP release\\n1. Osmotic pressure receptor: AVP release is affected by multiple stimuli, the release of AVP is mainly due to the regulation of the osmotic pressure receiver of the underwriter, and the changes of osmotic pressure is mainly due to the regulation of the osmotic pressure receptor of the underworket. The release feedback adjustment mechanism maintains plasma osmotic pressure in a narrow range, which is given to normal human 20 ml / kg water load, and the average plasma osmotic pressure is 281.7MOSM / KG · H2O in the human injection of high permeable salts after water load. The osmotic pressure is 287.3 / kg · h2o.\\n2. Capacity adjustment: blood volume decreases to stimulate the tension sensor of left atrium and lung veins, stimulate AVP release by reducing the tension inhibitory impulse impulse of the lower-looking holiday, in addition to this, is shouting, upright, warm environment The blood vessel diastolition can stimulate this mechanism to restore blood volume, and the capacity reduction can cause 10 times the concentration of the circulating AVP concentration to high permeability pressure.\\n3. Pressure receptor: hypotension stimulates the carotid artery and aorta pressure sensor, stimulating AVP release, low blood pressure caused by blood loss is the most effective stimulation, at which time plasma AVP concentration increases, while causing blood vessels Maintain the effect of blood pressure.\\n4. Nerve regulation: Many neurotransmitters and neuroptes have functions that regulate AVP release, such as acetylcholine, angiotensin II, tissue amine, combinity peptide, γ-neuride, etc., can stimulate AVP release, with The reactivity of plasma osmotic pressure during AVP increases, and plasma AVP concentration increases, and these physiological changes may increase the risk of water retention and low sathatemia in the elderly.\\n5. Drug effect: The drugs that stimulate AVP release include nicotin, morphine, Changchun, cyclophosphamide, chlorof butter ester, chlorosulfoate urea, and some tricyclic anti-worry-free drugs, ethanol can be inhibited neurose. The function produces diuretic effects, phenytoin, and chlorpromazine can inhibit the release of AVP and produce diuretic effects.\\n(3) AVP response to the prohibition of water and water load: the ban can increase the osmotic pressure to stimulate anti-diaper to release, the maximum urine osmosis pressure after the water changes with renal medullary osmotic pressure and other kidney factors, normal people ban After 18 ~ 24 hours, plasma osmication pressure exceeded 292MOSM / KG · H2O, plasma AVP concentration increased to 14 ~ 23Pmol / L (15 ~ 25 ng / L), after inhibition of AVP release, normal people drink 20ml After the water load of / kg, plasma osmotic pressure drops to an average of 281.7 mOSM / kg · H2O.\\n(4) AVP release and erassion: Under normal circumstances, the release of AVP and thirst is coordinated, both caused by mild increase in pulp osmotic pressure, raised to 292Mosm / kg · h2o When the above, the thirst is gradually obvious, until the urine concentration is mostly limited to the most under limited edition, so, in normal circumstances, the slightly sodium caused by water loss can increase the era, increase liquid intake, to restore and Maintain normal plasma osmination pressure, reverse\\n(5) The role of glucocorticoids: Adrenal hormones and AVP have a jealous resistance in the excretion of water, and the test can improve the normal transportation of high permeable saline causes the osmotic threshold release of AVP release, and the glucocorticoid can prevent water poisoning. When the adrenal cortical function is reduced, the body has an abnormal water load. When the adrenal function reduction is reduced, the urine release ability may be partially caused by excessive AVP in the cycle, but the glucocorticoid can directly act directly when AVP is lacking. The renal tubules reduce the permeability of water, and the excretion of free water is increased in the absence of AVP.\\n(6) Avp action cytology mechanism AVP effects of small kidney tubes:\\n1 AVP combined with the V2 receptor on the surface of the tubular cell membrane.\\n2 hormone-receptor complex is bonded to the protein activation adenylate cyclic enzyme by binding a bet.\\n3 Generation of cyclophosphate adenosine (CAMP).\\n4C-AMP is transferred to a cavity cell membrane to activate the protein kinase on the membrane.\\n5 protein kinase causes membrane protein phosphorylation.\\n6 The permeability of the cavity has increased the permeability of water, and the heavy absorption of water increases, many ions and drugs can affect the role of AVP, calcium and lithium inhibit the reaction of adenylate cyclogenic enzymes to AVP, and inhibit protein kinase depending on CAMP. Conversely, chlorosulfulinase enhanced AVP-induced adenylate cycloase activation.\\n2. Event dysfunction caused in any one of AVP generation and release\\nBy comparing the normal drinking water, water load, the change in plasma and urine osmination pressure can be summarized as a four-type:\\n1 type: When the water osmosis is significantly increased, the urine osmosis pressure is rare, and there is no release of AVP when injected with high permeable saline. This type does exist AVP lack.\\n2: The urine osmosis is suddenly increased during the injection of water, but there is no osmotic threshold, and these patients lack the osmotic pressure sensory mechanism, which can only stimulate the AVP release only when severe dehydration results in low school capacity.\\n3 type: As plasma osmotic pressure increases, the urine osmosis pressure is slightly raised, and the AVP release threshold is increased, and these patients have a slow AVP release mechanism, or the osmotic pressure sensitive is reduced.\\n4: Blood and urine osmosis curve move to the right side, this patient starts to release AVP when plasma osmotic pressure is normal, but the release amount is below normal, 2 to 4 patients, nausea, nicotine, acetylcholine , Chloroproase urea, a good anti-container effect, suggesting that AVP synthesis and storage are existing, released under appropriate stimulation, in very small cases, 2 ~ 4 patients can be asymptomatic High sathatemia and diabetes are very small, and even the basis for diaper symptoms.',\n",

Ectopic blood vessels: such as a vaginal vascular oppression from the lower pole.\\n2, fiber profile.\\n3, ureteral renal pelvis insertion.\\n4. Obstruction of Ureteropelvic Junction, Upjo and Valves.\\n5, the partial ureteral diapers caused by membrane adhesion, congenital renal water can also be caused by dynamic reasons such as segmentatic inability.\\nDue to other diseases of urinary traits, the primary disease can be found through routine examination, some diseases need to be clearly diagnosed by special inspections (such as CT, magnetic resonance imaging, etc.), these diseases mainly include:\\n1, obstructive lesions, tumors, polyps, stones, tuberculosis, inflammation, injury, malformations, diverticulum, kidney sagging, tuberculosis\\n2, oppression, abdominal, pelvic or peritoneal mass, intraperitoneal fibrosis, ectopic vessel, pregnancy and menstrual period, epithelial ovarian vein compression.\\n3, lower urinary obstruction, prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, urethral stenosis, bladder ureteral reflux, etc.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe normal function of the urinary system is the formation, storage, and discharge of urine. The formation of urine is filtered by glomerulos, the secretion of renal tubes, and the coordination of renal pelvis, and diastolic operation, Thereby, the renal sputum is about 10 cmH2O, ensuring that the urine passes smoothly, when the urinary tract obstruction, the intracene pressure can increase to 50 ~ 70cmH2O, on the one hand, the capsule is increased, and the glomerular capillaries are increased on the one hand. Reduce the pressure reduction, thereby reducing the filter over pressure until stopped, the reverse pressure of the urine causes the distal end of the renal tube, proximity, loss of the original secretion and reconstitution, due to the increase in the increase of the intra-renal pressure Pressure, especially after the output artery of glomerulopathy, the nutrition of renal tissue, renal nipple degradation shrinks, caused by convex shape, renal tubule system degradation, so that the kidney is substantially thin, and finally atrophy into a fibrous tissue sac. Observation of the hydrostatal tubes in the tuberculosis, mainly in the wall muscles, such as collagen tissue hyperplasia, deposition, and fiber tissue infiltration, which may be the main cause of local stenotic joints, ureteral contraction Disorder, urine retention can also form a obstruction, which is some renal water, and the renal urinary tube connecting portion is smooth but still causes obstruction. The intra-nephrid is not still constant, but often cycle, After 2 weeks of water water, the urine in renal pelvis is significantly reduced, while glucose and chloride have significant increased, and the pathway of the renal urine is absorbed may be:\\n1, renal dome venous reflux.\\n2, renal tube reflux.\\n3, interstitial reflux.\\n4, lymphatic reflux, so if you can relieve obstruction within 5 ~ 6 weeks, renal function can still be recovered, which is reminded that we can easily determine the renal water, especially acute obstruction. After the renal resection, the nephrid continues to develop, depending on the severity of obstruction (whether the obstruction is continuously developed), the adaptability (buffering effect) of the pyelone and kidney, and the speed of urine flow, if the relative balance is achieved, Stop development, thereby stabilizing in the mild kidney water stage.',\n",

Therefore, after the patient is infected with tuberculosis The reaction is related to whether there is a infection and an immune response caused by infection, the first infection is called the original infection or initial infection, and the infection that has occurred after an immune response or delayed allergic reaction is called the primary. POST-PRIMARY Infection or re-infection, the reaction in the body is different, generally in 3 to 4 weeks of initial tuberculosis infection, with the establishment of cellular immune or delayed allergic reactions, early non-special The heterosphic inflammatory response is replaced by the granulomatous tuberculosis nodule, the nodule is mainly composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and the center often has cheese-like necrosis, and 90% of patients are controlled, and the spread is contained.

       " 'The formation process of renal stones is somewhat, resulting in reduced crystal substance concentration in urine, in a state of supersaturated, precipitated crystals, and finally forms a stones in this process, in which uterine crystal substance is supersaturated. The formation of the state and the reduction in the crystallization in the urine are reduced by the most important factors.\\n(1) Formation of a full saturation state\\nSee 1 in 1 urine volume; 2 absolute excretions of some substances in urine, such as calcium, oxalic acid, uric acid, cystine and phosphate, etc., 3 urine pH changes (<5.5), urine When uric acid saturation increases, when urine PHT is increased, calcium phosphate, phosphate amphragmium phosphate is increased, and the urinary pH changes have little effect on calcium oxalate, sometimes the full-saturation state is short, can be short-lived. Decreased urine reduction or increased amounts of urinary disasters after meals, thus determining 24-hour urine volume and certain material urine displacement cannot help determine if there is a shorter supersaturated state.\\n(2) Reduced crystallization in urine\\nThe normal urine contains certain substances to inhibit the formation and growth of crystals, such as pyrophosphate inhibit calcium phosphate crystallization; mucin, citric acid and magnesium, inhibit calcium oxalate crystal formation, and the urine reduces these substances will be formed. stone.\\n(3) nucleation role\\nThe homogeneous nucleation refers to the crystallization formation of a crystal, calcium oxalate as an example, and the two ions form crystals when there is a supersaturated state, the higher the ion concentration, the more crystal, the larger the ion of the lower crystal is constantly falling off. The study suggests that only 100 ions containing more than 100 ions have sufficient affinity to make the outer sheet ions do not fall off, thereby reaching a balanced state, crystallization is constantly grown, at which time the desired ion concentration is lower than the crystal, when the crystal is just formed, different The quality core refers to the shape of the two crystals, and a crystallization can promote another crystalline to aggregation and growth as a core, such as the crystalline energy of uric acid to promote the formation and growth of calcium oxalate, and the diaper is formed. In local growth, it is conducive to developing as stones, many crystalline and small stones can be excreted by urine rifling, and when certain factors such as local stenosis, obstruction or such as urinary flow obstruction or slow, it is conducive to stones formation.\\n(4) Organic matrix\\nThe organic matrix can facilitate crystalline bonding to form a stones of a certain shape, but it is impossible to function in the formation process.\\nFactors affecting stones\\n(1) Urine crystal substance excretion increase\\n1. High calcium urinary normal people intake 25mmol calcium and 100 mmol sodium daily, the daily urinary calcium displacement <7.5 mmol (or 0.1molk / kg); 10 mmol calcium per day, urinary calcium displacement <5mmol, Continued high calcium urine is the most common independent abnormal factor in patients with kidney stones. The stones caused by calcium oxalate stones, correcting high calcium urine to effectively prevent kidney stones, and high calcium urine is very important in kidney stones. The role can be divided into the following four types according to its pathogenesis.\\n(1) Absorbing high calcium urine: the most common, see 20% to 40% of kidney stoned stones, the disease is mostly caused by some intestinal diseases (such as jejuno), increased intestinal calcium absorption, blood calcium increase, inhibiting parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, due to increased blood-filled calcium increases, PTH reduction is reduced by reducing weight, causing increased urinary calcium, increased calcium intake, VITD caused by VITD poisoning and sarcoidosis, It is also possible to cause absorbent high calcium urines, and such patients have increased from compensatory urinary calcium excretion, blood calcium concentration is often in the normal range.\\n(2) Renal high calcium urine: one of the special high calcium urine, accounting for 5% to 15% of patients with kidney stones, due to the abnormal renal tubule, especially the proximal tube function, resulting in heavy absorption calcium, such patients The secondary hyperparathyroidism is often increased, and PTH secretion is increased; while 1, 25- (oh) 2Vitd2 synthesis also increases, so that bone calcium mobilization and intestinal calcium absorption increase, patient blood calcium is often normal.\\n(3) bone absorbent high calcium urine: mainly seen from primary gyroidism, accounting for 3% to 5% of patients with kidney stones; 10% ~ 30% of the primary warprocerability, and kidney stones, and still see Bone absorption and Corcom syndrome caused by parapher gland function, metastatic tumor, long-term bed bed.\\n⑷ ⑷ ⑷ 高 高 高 高 高 高 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多 多The latter inhibits PTH secretion, thereby increasing urine calcium excretion.\\n2. The daily urethral acid discharge amount of the highlighity is 15 ~ 60mg, and the oxalic acid is a second important composition ingredient of kidney stones other than calcium. See the abnormality of intestinal oxalate, or intestinal highlighalic acid, accounting for 2% of patients with kidney stones, normal human intestinal calcium and oxalic acid combined with oxalic acid absorption, ileum disease (such as ileum cutting, empty - ileum bypass After the formation, infectious small bowel disease, chronic pancreas and biliary diseases) Due to the decrease in fat absorption, fat in the intestinal cavity is combined with calcium, so there is no sufficient calcium and oxalic acid stones, resulting in increased colon absorbing the decrease; without absorbing fatty acids and The biliary salt itself can also damage the colon mucosa, resulting in increased colonic absorption, in addition, when absorbing high calcium ururia, due to increased calcium absorption, oxalate absorption, highlighized uterine is too much, Vitb6 Lack, VITC intake and primary highlighized diapers, the latter type I and II type, type I is due to the lack of α-ketocarate acetate, resulting in acetalic acid procedure, oxidation to oxalic acid II lack of D-glycerol dehydrogenase, causing increased 1-glycerol acid increased, oxalic acid production, vinyl alcohol poisoning and methoxyalkane can stimulate the growth of oxic acid, any cause caused by highligh auria, kidney Small tube - interstitial damage, leading to kidney stones.\\n3. Urine uric acid normal people generally daily uric acid displacement is 13 mmol, and the only life of 10% ~ 20% calcium oxalate calculus patients, some people are called \"high uric acid oxalate stones\", and act as A separate kidney stone type, alternative, 40% hyperuronic acid urinary tract simultaneously with high calcium urine and low citrate regions, hyperreproiuretic diseases have primary and bone marrow proliferative diseases, malignant tumors, especially When chemotherapy ulcerative colitis, focal enteritis and empty-ileum bypass formation\\n4.

Xuanhai urine is a rare metabolic disease, which is blocked by the lack of xanthine oxidase, and the secondary xanthine is hindered to uric acid to uric acid, resulting in rising urinary xanthine (> 13 mmol / 24h), and Decreased urine acid, when applied acryon alcohol treatment, the uricine oxidase activity is increased by xanthine oxidase activity, but in the case of no body of the body, the numeral of the yellowish metabolism is generally absented.\\n(2) Effect of other ingredients in urine on stones formation\\n1. The urinary pH changes have an important influence on the formation of renal stones. The decrease in urine pH is conducive to uric acid stones and cystine stones; while pH increases to calcium phosphate stones (pH> 6.6) and phosphate magnesium phosphate magnesium phosphate PH> 7.2) is formed.\\n2. The urine volume is too small, the concentration of crystalline material in urine increases, which is conducive to the formation of a supersaturated state, and about 10% of kidney stone patients have no other abnormalities per day.\\n3. Magnesium ion magnesium ions can make the absorption of turcticate and inhibit calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate form crystallization in urine.\\n4. Citric acid can significantly increase the solubility of calcium oxalate.\\n5. Low citrate citric acid with calcium stones, reduce the saturation of calcium salt in urine, inhibit calcium salt, reduced citrate in urine, which is conducive to calcium-containing stones, especially oxalate stones, low Citrate diapers are seen in any acidified state such as renal tubic acid poisoning, chronic diarrhea, thiazide caused hyperobacine (cell acid poisoning), intracellular acid protein and urinary tract infection ( Bacterial decomposes citric acid), and some low citrates are unclear, low citrate can be used as unique ethosus (10%) (10%) (50%) (50%) in patients with kidney stones.\\n(3) urinary tract infection\\nContinuous or repeated urinary tract infections can cause infectious stones, bacteria such as deformation apolymetis, certain Krel Bacillus, Shareia, Nunette, and E. coli, can decompose urea to form ammonia, urine PH rises, promoting phosphate magnesium phosphate (MGNH4PO4 · 6H2O) and carbonate [CA10 (PO4) 6 · CO3] in a supersaturated state, and the pus and necrotic tissue at the time of infection have also caused crystallization to form on its surface. Stone, in some nephrology, abnormal disease such as ectopic kidney, polycystic kidney, horseshoe, etc., can occur due to repeated infection and urinary flow, the infection is still complications of other types of kidney stones, both. cause and effect.\\n(4) Diet and drugs\\nDrinking hardening; malnutrition, lack of Vita can result in falling off the urinary tract epithelium, forming a stones core; taking amino benomyne (as stone matrix) and acetrazole.\\nIn addition, approximately 5% of the strange patients do not have any biochemical abnormalities, and their stone is unclear.',\n",

After the 1960s, only 20% of the 1960s, but in countries and regions in the high incidence of tuberculosis, the adrenal tuberculosis is still primary adrenal cortical function. The primary reasons for the reduction, the proportion of the adrenal tuberculosis in my country is still relatively high. The adrenal tuberculosis is caused by blood dispersion, which can be accompanied by the tuberculosis of other systems, and the bilateral adrenal tissue comprises cortical and medulla damage, often more than 90%, The 3-layer structure of the adrenal cortex disappeared, and the lavivinal cortex, the residual adrenocortic cell was disappeared, and the residual adrenocortic cells were distributed, about 50% of patients had adrenal calcification, and the adrenal gland was significantly greater than normal.\\nSince the 1960s, in developed countries, with the tuberculosis, the total incidence of Adidinal disease decreased, the proportion of adennate tuberculosis in the etiological cause of Eddi also declined, and autoimmune adenitis has been promoted to Aidi The etiology, accounting for 80%, autoimmune adrenal adenitis, is called idiopathic adrenal peel atrophy, \"idiopath\" means unknown reason, now the cause is clear, it is considered to be the main evidence of autoimmune adrenal inflammation 1 Adrenal cortex atrophy, extensive transparent sample variability, often accompanied by a large amount of lymphocyte, slurry cells and monocytes infiltration; 2 more antibodies in serum in patients with antibodes; 3 often accompany other organs and Other autocodecanate autoimmune diseases, autoimmune adenitis generally does not affect myelosia.\\nAutologous immune adrenal inflammation can be exist independently, or other autoimmune diseases include endocrine or non-endocrine diseases, 2 or more endocrine gland, autostatical autocoder, is called autoimmune polyglysis Polyglandular AutoImune Syndrome, PGA, is divided into type I and II, type I has a significant family characteristic, often accompanied by skin mucosa alcoholosis (75%), adrenal cortical functional reduction (60%) and primary The quality of the sexrore adrenal density (89%) can also be premature ovarian function (45%), malignant anemia, chronic active hepatitis, absorption adverse syndrome and hair loss, etc., this is a common-stained hereditary hereditary disease.

Secondary adrenal cortical dysfunction is due to the insufficient secretion of the Pituitary disease caused by lack of secretion or the disease caused by the disease of the hypothalamus, the hypotectial ACTH secretion is insufficient, and the results can cause adrenal cortisol and hydrogen. The secretion of ephentone and oliene is insufficient, and the reasons are:\\n(1) Long-term large intraday intraoperative glycotheloid: Long-term large amount of external exogenous glucocorticoid is the cause of the most common secondary adrenal cortex, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal shaft is in a serious inhibitory state The symptoms of low adrenal cortical function are often present in 48 hours of stopping drugs, which can last for more than 1 year after stopping the drug.\\n(2) SHEHAN (Sheehan) disease, pituitary tumor strontium and craniocerebral injury: the pituitary hood injuries caused by the gangli strontium and craniocerebral injury due to postpartum pituitary hemorrhagic necrosis can cause acute pituitary front leaves and even The pituitary function is low, including relative adrenal cortical functional retardation, pitcological ACTH tumors and adrenal cortisol secretion, the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal adrenal shaft is still inhibited, and adrenal skin function usually requires half a year to 1 year to recover.\\n(3) Diseases such as hypothalamus, infiltration and infection: can cause low performance of the entire pituitary leaf hormone, and adrenal cortical functional reduction is one of the performance.\\n(4) Isolated activity ACTH lack: Less, and is unknown.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\n1. Primary adrenal skin returns include two pathophysiological factors: 1 is insufficient adenoid hormone in adrenal hormones; 2 is to promote adrenal hormone (ACTH) and its related peptides, such as globios, typical Aidi The adrenal destruction is generally 90%, but not only affects the beam belt and the mesh belt, but also affects the spherical belt, the adrenal tuberculosis also affects myelosia, so glucocorticoid, adrenal hormone and salt corticotenoids are lacking, glucocortic hormones That is, the lack of cortisol can cause fatigue, burnout, loss of appetite, disgusting and weight loss; can cause glycogen to weaken, the threat of hepatic sugar is increased to insulin sensitivity, and there is no hypoglycemia to hunger. It is easy to have a cold and other infections, and the lack of salt cortex hormone can cause increased sodium sodium in the body, loss of body fluid, decrease in blood volume, low blood pressure, hypoglycetal sodium, high blood potassium and mild metabolic acidosis; added glucocorticoid The catecholamine \"allowed\" to weaken, the amount of heart and peripheral resistance decreased, further aggravated the gaseous hypotension; the renal to the elimination ability of freewater, and the lack of adrenal hormone is prone to the lack of weak and the lack of weak androgen. It is a decrease in the falling and loss of mane and mane, and the secretion of ACTH and Mao Sin can cause skin mucosal pigmentation.\\n2. Secondary adrenal cortical dysfunction varies depending on the pathogenesis of the patient, because the physiological condition is mainly adjusted by renin-angiotensin, at the secondary adrenal cortical functional retardation ACTH It mainly leads to lack of glucocorticoid, aldosterone secretion is less affected. Therefore, in the secondary adrenal cortical functional retardation, although the cortisol is deleted on catecholamine \"allowed\" to reduce blood pressure, vascular pressure pressure (AVP) secretion increase It can cause dilution low satutama, but the water metabolism disorder and hypotension are light than the primary, while the growth hormone and thyroid hormone are lacking, which makes severe fatigue and hypoglycemia tendency more obvious; due to lack of ACTH And melanocyte stimulation (MSH), patients with non-skin mucosal pigmentation.\\n3. Adrenalone functional retardation, if it is not appropriately treated, or increases the glucocorticoid dose in time without timely stress, or the acute large area damage or pituitary stroke necrosis, leading to acute failure of adrenal cortex, causing adrenal crisis .',\n",

Ingest or input too much liquid containing electrolyte\\nSince the kidney has powerful adjustment of water balance, normal people can generally do not have water retention, and will not cause water poisoning, however, the thirsty and hub is more than too much or spirituality. Excessive drinking water, when the maximum limit of renal drainage capacity (1,200 ml / h) may also occur in water poisoning, especially infants, due to its water, electrolyte regulatory function is not yet mature, too much to give liquid mixture without electrolyte more easy Water poisoning occurs.\\n2. Acute and chronic renal function\\nWhen the renal function is incomplete, the drainage capacity of the kidney is reduced, and it is easy to generate water poisoning, especially the advanced intake of water in the late-time, and the late-time ingestion of the chronic renal failure. In this case, it is functional There are too few kidney units that cannot discharge daily water loads, so it can cause water poisoning even when intake of normal water.\\n3.

The stability of the environment (especially osmotic pressure and blood capacity) can produce a variety of influences, edema can occur when blood albumin is less than 25 g / L, while the blood capacity is reduced, it is quantified When the body fluid is lost, it is easy to induce low blood volumetric shock, and there is also low albuminiamia can also affect lipid metabolism.\\n(3) High cholesterol hypermia: may increase due to increased low protein blood compensatory albumin synthesis, some lipoprotein and albumin is increasing, and then the lipoprotein enzyme activity is reduced and other factors. Hyperlipidemia occurs, general plasma albumin <30 g / l, that is, blood cholesterol increases, such as albumin further decreases, and triglycerol also increases.\\n(4) Edema: The edema mechanism of nephrotic syndrome has not fully clarified, possible mechanism:\\n1 Due to the decrease in plasma albumin, the osmotic pressure of plasma colloid decreases, and the water in plasma is directly transferred to the tissue gap within the blood vessel.\\n2 Water extraction of blood capacity decreases, varying capacity and pressure sensors to change in vivo neuromics (such as anti-contrast hormones, aldehydene, sodium sodium factor, etc.), causing sodium sodium retention to cause systemic edema.\\n3 low blood capacity increases the intensity of sympathetic neurons, and near-terminal small tubular weight absorbs sodium increases, and the sodium retention is added.\\n4 Other renal reasons lead to increased sodium absorption of renal projections.\\nTherefore, edema of primary nephropathy syndrome may be the result of the common effects of the above many factors, and different patients may vary in different patients.\",\n",
       " \"1, the cause of children can easily urinate\\n(1) Physiological characteristics: Due to the use of diapers, the urinary tract is often polluted, and the local defense ability is poor, it is easy to cause upstream infections, the girl's urethra is more like this, the small baby body is poor, and it is susceptible to the bacterialmia. Result in downstream infection.\\n(2) Congenital malformations and urinary tract obstruction: The former is more common in adults, such as the nephrolifier interpolation, renal pelvic water, rear urinary valve, and polycystic kidney can cause the drainage and then infection, in addition to the neurological bladder , Stones, tumors, etc. causing obstruction, in the circle medical center with urethral malformation, can account for 25% to 50% of the total urinary tract infection.\\n(3) Bladder ureteral urine return (referred to as diabetic return): Infant and young children are common, foreign introduction is in children under 10 years old, 35% ~ 60% have a diaper return, but the number of domestic reports is very small. It still needs to be further observed. Under normal circumstances, the ureter has a section walking within the bladder wall. When the bladder is filled with urine, the bladder wall oppressed the urine to close, the urine can't return, in the infant In the early childhood, due to the short ureter walking in the bladder wall, there are not completely compromised during urination, and the bacteria caused infection with the reflux, and the harm of the diaper reflux is to lead to the formation of reflux nephropathy and kidney scar. In the age of 5, the degree of return is proportional to the kidney scar, and the mild return can disappear with the age of age, but the severe return is more operational, so, the children with urinary tract are specified, and there is no return. It is of great significance to clearly diagnosis and guidance treatment.\\n2, pathogenic bacteria\\n80% ~ 90% is pathogeneous by Galtobacillus, in the first primary urinary case, the most common is E. coli, followed by deformation bacilli, Krebacillus and Vice coli, a small number of feces. And Golden Staphylococcus, occasionally caused by viruses, mycoplasma or fungi, more than 90% of E. coli in patients with acute pyelonephritis is P-umbrella strain, and the adhesiveness of P-fimbriae is microorganisms. The reasons for upstream, the treatment is not thorough or the metroid structure is abnormal, and the bacterial is easy to produce resistance. It can cause repeated infection, delay, and turn into chronic, sometimes due to antibiotics, bacteria produce variation, cell membrane rupture, no Keep the original state, but can continue to survive in the high-permeable environment of the kidney, such as the premature stopper, the bacteria restore the original state of the disease, and this bacteria is not growing in general medium, only in high seepage, There is a nutritious medium to grow, so the clinical symptoms of chronic pyelonenritis are not improved, and the urine culture is repeatedly negatively negotiated, and the pathogen should be used as high infiltration.\\n3, infection route\\n1 more than girls infected;\\n2 blood infection occurs in newborns and small babies, common in pustular disease, pneumonia, and sepsis diseases;\\n3 a small number can be caused by lymphatic pathways and adjacent organs or tissues;\\n4 urinary tract instruments can also be a way to infection.\",\n",

Some car accidents or work injury accidents directly lead to penile trauma, and can also gradually develop into a lesion similar to PEYronie, and some patients denied sexual exchange or other incentives The history of pension damage caused by penis, the exact pathogenesis of these people is unclear.\\n2.

The outer layer is longitudinal fibers, the inner layer is annular, and the two layers are present on the back side and the abdominal side, and the longitudinal lines of the abdominal neutral line are thinner. It may be a single layer, the sponge bodies are arranged in a fan-shaped arrangement, and the fibers of the white film are closely intertwined together. Under normal circumstances, the sponge tissue has symmetrical elasticity, and the penis causes the white film stretch. Thin, if there is no inner fiber support structure, the penis erection is not hard enough, and the fibrous skeleton in the sponge provides this support structure, and the sponge cell septum is supported by most of the abdomen - back axial hardness of the erection.\\nWhen the white film sheath is extended to the limit, the interval and the abdomen-back white film sheath form a \"work\" word beam shape to resist the bending force from the back-abdominal side, accumulate blood generation in the sponge. Hydraulic, the active force of the surrounding white film is a right angle, the back side and the veneer force of the ventricular force extend the medium separation fiber microfilament, and when the penis is formed in the back-abdominal surface, the stress applied in this system is applied to this system. The part is concentrated in the interval and white film, and is the portion where the peyronie lesion occurs, so the curved shear force causes the white film to be separated from the white film, layer After separation, blood penetrates the separation layer gap, or causes the tumbler of the medium separation fiber to cause inflammation, hard knot, and final scar formation in the blood intake and the blood-infiltrated patient.',\n",

       " \"Etiology\\nThe basic cause of this disease is excessive in the body, especially the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea, etc., leading to tissue damage and lesions.\\nPathogenesis\\nAbout the hepatic bean nuclear relevance mechanism has the following studies: 1 Normal substance defects in the blend of copper in this type of patient, may be the combination of goose deoxycholic acid and taurine, resulting in bile secretion of copper functional disorders. The evidence that does not support this is that there is no quality change of bile copper binding proteins in patients, and there is no evidence that the patient has abnormal bile acid metabolism. 2 is abnormal, resulting in increased affinity of copper on copper, and supports the evidence of this study, and the copper-binding constant of copper-binding protein (liver copper protein) in Wilson patients is primary biliary hardening patient. The constant is 4 times, but people have questioned the analysis method of the information. Therefore, whether abnormal protein in Wilson diseases on copper is the formation mechanism of Wilson's disease needs to be further clarified. 3 The most reasonable learning is that the lysosome of liver cells is involved in the metabolic process of copper. The experiment was observed that the liver cytosurizoid content of Wilson patients was 40 times higher than that of Wilson patients with hepatocyte lysosome defects. The process of interfere with copper is secreted from the lysosomal into the bile, resulting in an increase in the amount of copper content of the liver of Wilson patients.\\nIn summary, Wilson is not due to the increase in the absorption of copper on the intestines, but due to the secretion of copper on the biliary tract, this obstacle is congenital, there is a patient with genetic defects, and it cannot be combined in 3 months after birth. It is normal to make the copper positive balance metabolism, resulting in the accumulation of copper in the body.\\nPathological change\\nFirst, the liver\\nThe earliest histological change is the original degeneration of hepatocytes under the peripheral area of \\u200b\\u200bthe leaflet under the mirror. The nuclear glycogen is a block or a empty foam shape, which has a medium degree of fat infiltration. The fat drop was composed of triglyceride, and the number of fat drops was increased, and the fusion increased. The fat degeneration is similar to alcohol fatty degeneration, coeximited with fat degeneration or in the fat degeneration, has a geostational of mitochondria, increased mitochondrial volume, membrane separation, crest expansion, and crystalline arrangement, and void, The matrix is \\u200b\\u200bsignificantly granulated. Mitochondrial changes may be related to fat degeneration in pathogenesis. With the treatment of D-pantiamillus, mitochondrial changes can be reduced or even disappeared, and the change in mitochondria is caused by the toxicity of copper.\\nThe liver is different from fat infiltration to cirrhosis. Some patients can have chronic active hepatitis, which may have monocyte infiltration, most of which are lymphocytes and slurry cells, can have debris, and this necrosis can cross the interface, can have liver substance collapse, bridge necrosis And liver fibrosis, this chronic active hepatitis is identified. The liver disease can naturally relieve naturally, which can be developed as a large biovisible liver hardening or quickly develop into anomatitis, the latter treatment is very poor.\\nIn the process of cirrhosis, there may be inflammatory cell infiltration or substantial necrosis in the formation of hepatitis, and finally form a cirrhosis coexisting with a small node syndrome or a small nodules of the nodules. The fiber separation can be width, and the biliary tube hyperplasia is Some pathological changes in early disease, such as ribosome denaturation, fat degeneration, etc.\\nSecond, the brain\\nThe entire nervous system can be affected, and the bean core, the vocabulary, the tail core, the body of the body is heavy, and the shell nucleus in the soybean nucleus is most significant. The naked eye can be seen that the cerebral hemisphere has different degrees of atrophy, small softening, softening and small hole formation, histological display of neurocyte denaturing necrosis, star-collagen hypertrophy, hyperplasia and denaturation.\\nThird, the kidney\\nCopper is calm in the nearla cell, showing fat degeneration and water sample.\\nFourth, cornea\\nCopper sinking around the descemet film of the descemet film to form a brown green pigment, called the Kayser-Fleischer ring.\",\n",

Comparative spinal cord, more common in hard ridge film, under the hard ridge film, uncommon, non-bacterial infectious spinal spinal inflammation, as well as damage, bleeding, chemical, chemical, intrathecal intrathecal injection, etc. The spinal inflammation caused by unknown causes, can cause the spinal cord to be adhesive, and even the submest form cysts and oppress the spinal cord. In addition, some specific inflammation such as tuberculosis, parasite granuloma can also cause spinal cord oppression.\\n3. Damage\\nSpinal cord injury is often combined during spinal injury, and the spinal damage can cause spinal cord oppression due to vertebral bodies, pedicle and laminate fracture, dislocation, small joint interleave, intervertebral disc protrusion, spinal tube internal hematoma formation, etc.\\n4. Spinal cord vessel deformity\\nThe abnormality caused by congenital embryonic development, the next day disease, damage, damage, arteriosclerosis, etc. can cause spinal cord vascular malformation to date, the cause of spinal cord vessels cause spinal cord dysfunction, except for narcotic blood vessels Except for expansion expansion, it also causes spinal cord ischemic damage due to arterial short circuit and venous congestion.\\n5.

The intervertebral disc protruding can also be due to the dehydration of myeloid itself, there is no obvious damage factor, more occurred in the neck, can have more than one myeloid protrusion, long course, slow symptoms, this is the spinal degenerative lesion Part.\\n6. Others\\nSome congenital spinal diseases, such as skull base depressions, atlantic habiting, cervical fusion, spinal fracture, ridge spinal cord bulging, spinal detholar, severe hyperbulfur, etc. can cause spinal cord oppression .\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nThe spinal cord is hidden in the osteogenic spinal compartment, its tissue structure and biological characteristics are similar to brain tissue, rich in moisture, soft and fragile, irreparable, and is more sensitive to blood oxygen, these characteristics decisions The pathological changes and clinical features of spinal cord on oppression and ischemic damage, from the pathogenesis, different compression factors and their development speed determine clinical manifestations.\\nIn general, any of the effects of oppression is always two aspects, one is mechanical oppression, and the second is blood disorders, the mechanical factors are fast, almost immediately appear, strong injuries, compression is released The function is slow, and it takes a few hours. After several days, it will gradually recover. The various organizations of the spinal cord it also have different tolerances, and the tolerance of the gray is generally higher than the white matter, the crude nectus fiber The tolerance of oppression is poor than fine fibers, so it is easy to damage, tactile, and body sensation of the nerve fibers (diameter 12 to 15 μm), pain and temperature of the nerve fibers (diameter 2 to 5 μm), so At the same time, when both are pressurized, the former has appeared earlier, but after relief, the recovery is faster, it is complete, generally, the longer, the longer from the spinal cord to the complete dysfunction, the longer, complete functional disorder The shorter time, the faster the function recovery in the re-press, the more complete, the blood disabilities is slow, and the blood supply and demand will have symptoms after 1 to 5 min. After restoring blood supply, the function is fast, but if blood supply is completely resistant Broken more than 10 min, the spinal cord will result in severe ischemia, difficult to restore, early spinal cord pressure, blood circulation disorder is reversible, but the degree of compression is excessive, that is, it is not reversible, the artery is insufficient after pressure , Causes spinal cord degeneration and softening, congestion after intravenous pressure, causing spinal cord edema, thus aghache, increase the pressure and damage of spinal cord, white matter is strong, and fine fibers are stronger than crude fiber.\\nClinical\\nSince the causes of pathogenic factors have different speeds, spinal cord oppression can be divided into three types of acute, subacute and chronic.\\n1. Acute compression is due to damage (herein referring to the injury, the spinal hematoma formation or the spinal cord of the fracture sheet is compressed), metastatic tumor, acute hard ridge membrane, and spinal hemorrhage.\\nIts placeholder volume exceeds the reserve gap of the spinal cavity of the compression site in a short period of time, and there is a pathological change, usually the venous blood reflow is first blocked, and the venous pressure increases the moisture excessively penetration. Outside blood vessels, the cells in the cells increases, the neuronal cells, gum cells, and the neuroofire swelling in the pressure regions have increased the volume of spinal cord, which exacerbates oppression, lesions further develops the arterial dysfunction, cell tissue hypoxia, producing metabolic disorders , Acid product accumulation, increased cell membrane permeability, intracellular, outer potassium, sodium ion exchange, a series of biophysical changes such as intracellular calcium overload, solubility, Fchlings, etc. The degree of degree and ischemic is significantly related to the post-damaged axial paste function, and will eventually lead to complete obstacles for spinal cord function.\\nThe cell body and its axon edema are visible under the microscope, increased cellular fluid, cell and fiber degeneration, softening, break, dissolved liquefaction, and necrosis, and finally form fibrous connective tissue scarring and spider mesh, hard ridge film adhesion, cerebrospinal fluid circulation, cerebrospinal fluid circulation The spinal cord below the pressure plane is due to the loss of contact with the central part, and the cells have gradually atrophic change, the neural fiber is deroud, the spinal cord is shrunk, and the spider reticulin is different degrees.\\nThe above pathological changes have been developed to end, and it is the pathological foundation of the loss of spinal cord. The degree of oppression is different from the stage of oppression. The changes are different. If the degree of oppression is light or early, the cells are only edema and mild edema samples. In this case, if it can be relieved, the damage is reversible. When the orpatator has been dissolved, the cytostomy is separated from the cytoplasty, and it is difficult to recover the compression factors, and the function is difficult to recover, generally in the pressure of the central region.\\n2. Chronic compression is the spinal tube inner tumor such as nerve sheath, ridge tumor, fat tunoma, benign terata, cyst, etc., etc. Suddenly, when the lesion is slowly developed, the spinal cord gradually obtains adaptation and compensation capabilities, or obtains sufficient blood supply due to the establishment of the side branch cycle, and can disappear in the vertebral tissue, the vertebra The tube is expanded, the laminate, pedicle and vertebral bodies are changed, and osteoporus is eroded, so that the spinal cord is reduced.\\nThe pathological changes of chronic pressure and acute pressure are completely different, and the compression cause can be considerably, the spinal cord cavity has been completely blocked, and the spinal cord can still have no obvious water swelling. On the contrary, the spinal cord is small, and it is only the size. The original half or smaller, the spinal cord is pushed to the side of the arcuate bend, and the pressure portion exhibits a concave trace, and the size of its size varies from the size of the occupied lesion. It can be seen in the surface, and the spider mesh is Different degrees of adhesion, the nerve roots are pulled or oppressed, which is the pathological foundation of root pain and segmental sensation or motion disorder.\\nThe above pathological changes determine the following clinical features of chronic spinal cord pressure.\\n(1) Compensatory: The spinal caution process is slow and gradually adaptive and compensatory ability, in a quite a long period of time (more than 1 year), there is no clinical symptom, as oppressed, the appearance of the symptoms is often In order to order, the binding compression often occurs the symptoms of nerve root stimulation or damage, or the corresponding damage symptoms can be caused by oppressing the conductive bundle, and then the semi-symptoms of the spinal cord is completely obstacles. The whole process is often more than 1 to more than 1 to more, and the neurosurgery of Renji Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Second Medical University has 2 patients with female nerve sheath, and the lesions are 4 and 7 years, and they have been inspected to confirm that the vertebral lumen is completely blocked. However, the patient can still manipulate housework, up and down stairs, and the spinal cord seen in surgery has been oppressed to 1/3 of the original size, which is enough to explain the spinal cord to chronic oppression tolerance and compensatory ability.\\n(2) Volatility: The chronic spinal cord is long, and the trend of its clinical symptoms is constantly aggravated, but some cases have stable period after a certain symptom or a set of symptoms, and no longer aggravate, even There is a mitigation or alleviating, heavy and relatively reset, can have repeated, fluctuations in this symptom, commonly seen in the cystic changes of tumors, vascular tumors and intervertebral disc herniation, some neuroplastic patients also fluctuate Sexual clinical manifestations, some due to the relief of drugs and physiotherapy symptoms, and the fluctuations of the symptoms are always higher than one high, or they are also accompanied by new symptoms or signs, eventually will eventually appear spinal cord Functional damage, (3) Segmentation: Spinal motion and sensory nerve have segmental characteristics, there is a different part of the spinal cord of different segments, the spinal cord of the different segments, the spinal cord pressure, the sensory and reflection barriers, and the early appearance of myeloid compression lesions Root pain, \"meat jump\", is the performance and characteristics of this segmentation device.\\n(4) Multipleness: The spinal cord oppression caused by tumors is more common, but it also sees multiple tumors simultaneously or sequentially oppressed different planes of the spinal cord, such as multiple nerve fibroma disease and metastatic tumors.

       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nGenerally speaking, tension headache is associated with a psychiatric headache, in a new classification, and the tendacial muscle disease in new classification, TTH is divided into 2 subtypes:\\n1. EpisoDic Tension-Type, ETTH\\n(1) Pressure tensioned headache related to skull peripheral muscle disease.\\n(2) The homogeneous tensioned headache that is not related to the intracranial muscle disease.\\n2. Chronic Tension-Type, CTTH\\n(1) Chronic tensioned headache associated with skull peripheral muscle disease.\\n(2) Chronic tensioned headache with undesirable patients with intracranial muscle disease.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nAlthough tensioned headache is a common headache, it has not been fully clear for its pathogenesis. In recent years, the research status is summarized as follows:\\n1. That and the relationship between intracranial muscle disease\\nSince 1940, the relationship between the two has been discussed, but the muscle disorder is the cause of TTH or the result, or only one of the factors in the pathogenesis of the TTH, has no conclusion.\\nPeterson et al. (1995) did a study of a group of TTH patients in the headache, and Site Specificity was studied. They used Subjective Self-Report Rating to detect 5 muscles. Including the degree of muscle tension (Muscle Tension), and observe the degree of muscle tension (Muscle Tension), and observed the level of muscles in these muscles, although detailed quantitative observations are done for each muscle. The results did not find a significant relationship between muscle pain and muscle tension and myocardial activity level, Jensen et al. (1998) 28 cases of subtype CTTH and ETTH, quantified, cruined, and hot pain The threshold and temporal muscle muscle electromicular activity were observed. It was found that at CTTH accompanied by a patient with skull peripheral, there was a significant reaction to mechanical stimuli, the more remarkable, and its tactile The more sensitive response is also sensitive, and myocardial activity has also increased significantly, but there is no abnormality for the thermal pain stimulation threshold. The above changes are not obvious in ETTH patients. In recent years, Bansevicius et al. (1999), muscle pain, tension in patients with TTH patients There is also a correlation study between the pneumatic reaction. Experiments use visual analog table (Visual Analog Scale, VAS) to record the extent, left and right temporal muscles, neck and left shoulders of muscle pain, and simultaneously Shallow myocardial activity, another Tension and fatigue (Fatigue) adopt inquiry mode, by the patient self-assessment, according to VAS method, through the above quantitative studies discovery: fatigue and pain, in all experimental processes There is a significant correlation, the tired is like a headache, the longer the headache time, the more tired feelings; but the correlation between tension and pain is weak, only related to the experimental period, and only in the neck muscle, As for myocardial activity and pain, there is no correlation between tension and fatigue between myocardium activity and fatigue, so the author believes that the role of tension in TTH is not protruding.\\n2. The relationship between Tth and psychological changes\\nCATHEART et al. (1998), induced the relationship between involved emotions and ETTH, they used the experimental study of biological psychology, and they used the Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List (ADACL) It was subtraction analysis of the induced strength, Tiredness, Tension and Calmness, and found that the tension level of ETTH patients was higher than that in the control group, even if there is no headache, it is non-headache During the period, its tension is significantly lower than the head pain, and therefore it is related to tension and headaches.\\n3. THH and vascular headache relationship\\nSince the clinical headache and migraine occurs simultaneously in the same patient, and some patients initially appear to be migraine, when the frequency of occurrence is gradually increased, it appears to be ETTH, and can be converted to CTTH, so these two types of headache There were many reports, such as Tackeshima et al. (1998) indicated many common situations between the muscle contracted headache and the migraine and migraine. The platelets 5-HT can be reduced, and the plasma 5-HT can be raised. The sympathetic nervous function of the outer autonomic nervous system can be low, and the genetic studies have found that both migraine and muscle contracted headache were in the same family. Recently, Hannerz et al. (1998) proposed whether CTTH is angioplasia? Their experimental study is to follow the patients with CTTH patients, respectively, with low-low position of the tongue, to induce a headache, and the health control group failed. Inductive headaches, while CTTH patients have a headache intensify, and Duplex Ultrasound Systems detect the pipe diameter and blood flow of the neck of the neck, and the intensity increase of headache is related to the increase of pipe extension. , That is, the tube diameter is increased, the strength of headache is increased, the pipe diameter is small, but the strength of the headache is also reduced, but the blood flow changes in the blood vessels have nothing to do. Therefore, the authors believe that the headache of CTTH patients is closely related. Relationship, since the patient\\'s headache alleviates slowly after the end of the head is slow, it is considered that the head pain is caused by insufficient intravenous reflow or venous expansion.\\n4. Nearly close some of the biochemical observations of TTH\\nSome scholars have seen TTH from biochemical, such as Oishi et al. (1998) to detect plasma platelet factor 4, β-thrombin and 11-dehydrogenolithoxane B2 level, and found that the above three of the three substances of ETTH patients It was significantly higher than that of the CTTH group and the control group, which considered that the headache and platelet dysfunction of ETTH patients were particularly close, Mishima et al. (1997) found that the serum platelet magnesium ion level in patients with TTH was reduced, considered to be related to platelet function, Martinez, etc. (1994) It was found that the level of plasma 5-hydroxylamine in TTH was higher than that of the control group, and the catecholamine level was lower than that of the control group, the plasma dopamlamine level was positively correlated with headache, and the level of adrenaline and headache was negatively correlated. In addition, monoamine levels and depression The degree does not have correlation, these results suggest that the central monamer can be changed in the center of the TTH patient, which has changed and the depression, and the pathophysiological mechanism of a headache, Marukawa et al. (1996) found TTH The patient\\'s head pain during the saliva in saliva increased significantly, and considered to be released from the painting system.\\nIn summary, the above example shows that the pathogenesis of TTH is still studying from many aspects. So far, the relationship between headaches and muscles, the relationship between headaches and depression, and even \"tension\" refers to the muscles and mental psychology concept.

The circulation, the last metabolism is CO2 and H2O, and the metabolism of ethanol is a speed limit, the ethanol removal is 2.2 mmol / kg.h (100 mg / kg.h), and the adult can remove ethanol 7 g (100% ethanol 9 ml) per hour. Ethylene ethanol concentration decreased rate of about 0.43 mmol / h (20 mg / dl.h) Although the increase in blood ethol was affected by personal tolerance, the blood ethanol residual concentration was not different, generally 87-152mmol / L ( 400-700 mg / dl).\\nSecond, poisoning mechanism\\n(1) Acute role\\n1, the central nervous system inhibits ethanol having ester soluble properties, can quickly transmit cell membranes in the brain, and acts on certain enzymes on the membrane, the inhibition of cellular nervous system, with the increase of dose, Down by the brain mechanism, through the marginal system, the cerebellum, the mesh structure to extension, the small dose is excited, which is due to ethanol acting in the brain in the brain synaptic film-benzene nitroza - R-aminobutyric acid receptor, Thereby inhibiting the inhibition of R-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the brain, the concentration of ethanol in the blood is increased, acting on the cerebellum, causing the union, acting on the mesh structure, causing a sleeping and coma, extremely high concentration of ethanol inhibiting the brain The center causes breathing, cycle failure.\\n2, metabolic abnormal ethanol generate a large amount of NADH in the liver metabolism, increase the intracellular reduction oxidation ratio (NADH / NAD), or even 2-3 times the normal, alcoholism, depending on NADH / NAD is more metabolism An abnormality occurs, such as the increase of lactic acid, the accumulation of ketogenesis causes a metabolic acid toxic, and hypoglycemia can occur.\\n(2) Tolerance, dependence and illegal syndrome\\n1. Receive a relaxed and exciting, and then to drink alcohol, continue to drink, tolerant, and reduce the amount of drinking to achieve the original effect.\\n2, dependent to get a special pleasure after drinking, eager to drink, this is psychological dependence, physical dependence refers to repeated drinking to cause a physiological and biochemical change in the central nervous system, so that alcohol is still in the body to avoid Specially referred to as a condition for a critical syndrome.\\n3. If you have a long-term drinking, you have formed a physical dependence after drinking, once you stop drinking or reduce drinking, you can have a symptom against alcohol poisoning, and the mechanism is generally alcoholic to suppress the effect of alcohol to reduce the role of GABA, while plasma retreat Increasing concentration of adrenaline increases symptoms.\\n3 Long-term alcoholism\\n1. Nutrition lack of wine beverage poisonous glycol can supply 29.3 kJ (7kcal) heat, but there is no necessary nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and amino acids, so alcohol is a drink of high-calorie and non-placement ingredients, and the long-term drinking is reduced. It can cause significant nutrition lacking, lack of vitamin B1 can cause Wernicke-Korsokoff syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, some have a heredible induction of vitamin B1 needs, may also be the cause of onset, folic acid lack of giant cell anemia, long-term When hunger, when the sugar supply is insufficient, the fat decomposes dominant, and some of the acetyl CoA is synthesized by synthetic ketone.\\n2, toxic effecting ethanol has stimulating the mucosa and gland, which can cause esophagitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, and ethanol to produce free radicals during metabolism in vivo, which can cause cytospermia to peroxide, causing liver damage.',\n",

Some patients will also induce in the absence of mental height. It may be due to the disorder of the patient's vascular sports nerve center, so that the tip arterial smooth muscle tension increases, sensitive to stimulation The degree increases.\\nRenault syndrome is more common in women, and patient symptoms are aggravated during menstruation, and during pregnancy, it is considered to be related to the secretion level of sex hormones.\\nIn the middle of the workers who have been engaged in vibrating operations such as fans, chainsaws, Renault syndrome can be as high as 50%. Studies have shown that the vibration frequency is 125 Hz, and the opponent refers to the impact tension of the peripheral artery, and the pathology can In addition, the incidence of Renault syndrome has increased significantly in the refrigerated food industry.\\nThere is a considerable part of the idiopathic Renault syndrome, which exhibits primary diseases (Table 1) in follow-up, and the distal ischemic changes caused by these diseases are mainly controlled by arteriosclerosis or chronic artery disease, local thrombosis. It causes the peripheral arterial occlusion, but not simple arteries.\\nPathogenesis\\nTypical trians in Renault syndrome is pale, green purple and flush, and fingers are mainly due to the slow blood vessel perfusion, resulting in reduced blood flow within skin vessels; after a few minutes due to hypoxia And metabolite accumulation allows the capillary may also include a small vein slightly expanded. There is a small amount of blood flow into capillaries, rapid deoxidation caused blue violet; limb endasis release, a large number of blood enters the expanded capillaries, that is, reactive congestion, skin The color is turned to the flush; when the blood flow is restored, the capillary perfusion is normal, the attack is stopped, and the color is normal.\\nThe pathogenesis of the blood vessel shrinkage in Renault syndrome has been investigated, and Renault believes that Renault syndrome is caused by neurological function, but this theory is negated by Lewis, Lewis has been negatively used in clinical resequent patients. The autonomous and body wall nerves, but it does not effectively prevent the attack of Renault syndrome. He believes that Renault syndrome is due to local vascular function defects, and the vascular wall high response is caused by stimulation of cold and other stimulation.\\nWhen the shrinkage of the artery is greater than the expansion force of the arterial tube cavity, the blood flow within the artery is terminated, and the study of Lewis shows that when Renault syndrome, the blood flow of the artery is completely interrupted, resulting in the pressure of the arterial blood flow interruption 0.667 KPA (5mmHg), clinical observation shows that there are two pathophysiological mechanisms that have caused Renault syndrome to have two pathophysiological mechanisms, examples of arterial occlusion and arteries.\\nPatients with close-end arterial occlusion, the normal vascular contraction reaction caused by the decrease in the dilatation, cold and emotional stimulation, can cause the arterial blood flow to terminate, Renault syndrome, many disorders Small arterial occlusion, the most common cause is the arteritis associated with atherosclerosis and autoimmune connective tissue disease, normal human artery contraction period is 1.33 ~ 2.00KPa (10 ~ 15mmHg), refers to The absolute pressure of the artery is less than 4.00 kPa (30 mmHg) or two finger arterial pressure differences> 2.00kpa (15 mmHg), there is a significant bow or means of arterial occlusion, and the volumetric resection method has shown that there is an arterial occlusive lesion and the arterial cold sensitivity There is a quantitative relationship, the bows and finger pulse occlusion leads to a patient with significant decrease in the pressure in the mechanical pulse cavity, which is prone to Renault syndrome.\\nThe pathophysiological mechanism of Renault syndrome caused by arterial spasm has not been completely clear. There is no significant bow and finger pulse closure in patients with spastonia, and the arterial pressure is normal. The patient has no obvious lesion, but under cold stimulation, the blood flow of the artery can be completely interrupted, and Krahenbahl et al., Patients with spasm in the cold stimulation, referred to the blood flow dynamics of the artery, when the temperature drops to Prior to 28 ° C, the patient refers to the decrease in arterial pressure. When the temperature drops to 28 ° C, the sputum suddenly occurs, and the arterial blood flow is interrupted.\\nClinical and experimental studies have shown that the adrenergic neurological activity of patients with spasm in Renault syndrome is increased, and the normal human finger is short-made, and the blood flow of the capillaries has no significant changes, and the sparratual Renault syndrome is at room temperature. Under the cold stimulation, the flow rate of arteriovenous diversion and capillaries is significantly reduced, and after the sympathetic blockage, patients with sparratic Renault syndrome are stimulated at room temperature and cold stimulation, and the flow rate increases significantly, these Studies have shown that adrenaline neurological enhancement may be the main factor in pathophysiology of sputum Renault syndrome.\\nChanges in vascular smooth muscle cell α-adrenal energy receptors may be related to repeated cold stimulation, which may also be related to pathophysiological mechanisms in patients with sparratic Renault syndrome, KEENAN and PORTER research showed that 性In the middle, the level of α2-adrenal energy receptor is significantly higher than that of the occlusive Renault syndrome and normal people, the serum cultivated by the sputical Renault syndrome, the normal human platelet, normal human platelet α2-adrenal energy receptor level is obvious Declination, and the control group did not change this, these studies have shown that the regulation of the receptor is carried out by increasing the synthesis of the cellular receptor, although the receptor level on the serum microfoils and the acoustic smooth muscle is still needed in humans. Further quantitative studies, but experiments and clinical research support the direct contact of both, and believe that the changes in receptor levels are the most fundamental abnormalities in many factors.\\nMany other factors are also considered to participate in the pathological process of spasm Renault syndrome, such as changes in blood viscosity, abnormal serum protein, the increase in 5-hydroxylamine levels in serum and changes in vascular stress, etc., recently It is believed that vascular effects related peptides, such as calcium-related peptides, endothelin, etc. also participate in the incidence of spasmic Renault syndrome, but most patients are not the main factors.\",\n",

Mechanism of the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage\\nIn the mechanism, it is actually caused by a single factor, but may be caused by several integrated factors, and the mechanism of hypertension forming cerebral hemorrhage has many statements. It is more recognized that micro-anti-aramidism is generally considered simple. The increase in blood pressure is not sufficient to cause cerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral hemorrhage is often happening on the basis of mercyntropic lesions.\\n(1) Micro-theneurysm rupture: due to the long-term tension caused by high blood pressure in the brain, the weaknesses of the blood vessel wall form aneurysm, which is generally 500 μm, and the intracerea in the brain in patients with hypertension forms many micro-arteries. Tumor, multi-distributed in the tartr artery, brain bridge, brain, cerebral white matter and cerebral brain in the artery of 100 to 300 μm, this aneurysm is formed in a weak portion of the vascular wall, when the blood pressure suddenly increases, this The seed cystic vessel is easy to rupture causes cerebral hemorrhage.\\n(2) Fat glass sample or fiber necrosis: long-term high blood pressure on the brain, 100 ~ 300 μm, small air-wear arterial tube wall, the endometrium, the lipids within the plasma enters the inner membrane, so that Wall thickening and plasma cell infiltration, forming fat glass samples, and finally causes the tube wall to die, it is easy to rupture when blood pressure or blood flows drastically.\\n(3) Brain atherosclerosis: There are diverse lesions at the same time of most hypertension patients, including local fat and composite sugar accumulation, bleeding or thrombosis, fibrous tissue growth and calcium sink, cerebral atherosclerosis patients Brain infarction occurs, the arterius of the bulk cerebral deficiency softening zone is easy to rupture, forming a bleeding necrosis lesion.\\n(4) The outer membranes and middle layers of the cerebral artery are weak: the cerebral artery and the deep puncturing - soybean artery taken, this anatomical structure is suddenly elevated by factors such as force, excitement, etc. This blood vessel is easy to rupture bleeding.\\n2, pathophysiological mechanism for cerebral hemorrhage\\n(1) The main pathological changes: blood vessels form a hematoma, and the surrounding tissue has sponge variability after 30 min after hematoma; after 6 hours of neighboring brain substance, change over time and far from the necrotic, bleeding layer, sponge Determination and edema, etc.\\nThese changes in brain tissue around hematoma have plagued plasma, blood cell components, such as hemoglobin and other vascular active substances.\\nAfter hemorrhagic, the increasing cranial content increased, destroys the stability of the intracranial environment, which caused the cerebral pressure to further increase, and also affects local cerebral blood flow and coagulous fibril system function.\\nIn addition to the occupancy of the hemorrhage of the cerebral hemorrhage, there is also a blood circulation barrier, metabolic disorder (such as acidosis), metabolic disorder, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier damage and blood decomposition products release a variety of bioactive substances Brain tissue damage.\\n1 Molecular material: albumin in plasma, cell membrane-based splitting solution and macromolecular substance released within cells can participate in cerebral edema formation.\\n2 vascular active substances in hematoma: blood vessel active substance in hematoma can disperse to brain tissue, causing vasospasm, vascular expansion or vascular permeability.\\n3 blood vessel active substances outside hemamama: a histamine, 5-hydroxyamine, kini, brady peptide, peanut tetrakenoic acid, and its metabolites, can increase brain tissue damage.\\n4 free radical: erythropoietic damage, hemoglobin decomposition releases iron ions and heme, can induce a large number of free radicals, and increase brain damage.\\n5 activated enzyme release: neuronyl cells contain a large amounts of lysosomes, all kinds of hydrolase release into cytoplasm, making neurons further damage or necrosis.\\n6 endothelin release: endothelin produced by vascular endothelial cells can cause intracellular calcium ion overload, causing blood vessel contraction, adding cerebral ischemia.\\n7 excitatory neurotoxic amino acids: Increase in excitatory amino acids in injury to promote neuroblock necrosis.\\n8 Participation in various immune responses: various chemokines promote neutral leukocytes to lesions, and produce active substances, enzymes, and free radicals, which cause direct and severe damage to local brain tissue.\\n(2) Brain edema formation: edema is the most severe in the bleeding stove, the same side cerebral cortex, the parallel cortex, the lateral cortex, and the cerebral edema around the hematoma has both blood vessels, there is cytotoxicity, away from the cerebral edema of the lesion. Results and experiments showed that autologous blood injection mouse tail nuclear studies revealed that in 24 hours, it was kept constant in 24 hours, and it was kept constant until the 5th day began to regress.\\n(3) Effect of cerebral hemorrhage on the state of coagulation, anticoagulation, and fibrus: It is generally believed that the tissue coagulinary enzyme after the acute brain tissue is released, so that the coagulation activity in the blood is increased, and the resistance of antithrombin is reduced, and the fibrinolysis The increase in active compensatory, the study of the coagulation process found that the release of prismsis in the formation process after bleeding, the release of probling enzymes during the formation of coagulation blocks caused neighboring cerebral edema, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and cytotoxic effect.\\nIn addition, red blood cells are dissolved, and 3 days in the initial bleeding, it is another mechanism of cerebral edema formation, which may be related to the release of zein hemoglobin and its degradation products, recently, free radical, excitatory amino acid and membrane to calcium Transparent, is an important factor in ischemic brain injury, oxygen free radicals may be derived from peanut tetrane acid release, catenol metabolism, leukocyte activation, nitric oxide synthesis and other pathophysiological processes, three-price iron release, prompting The oxide and hydrogen peroxide transform into a greater hydroxyl group, which is an ischemic brain edema, and the blood and brain substance can produce superior oxygen negative ions, which is approximately to the blood decomposition product comprising three The price is related.\\nIn summary, although the pathological physiological mechanism of cerebral hemorrhage is very complicated, understand the pathological process of brain damage when hemorrhage will help drug treatment and promote hematoma absorption and the recovery of neurological function, at the same time, for cerebral hemorrhage The awareness of pathophysiological mechanisms is to be further deepened.\\n3, the main pathological changes of cerebral hemorrhage\\n(1) Bleeding site: about 70% of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage occurred in the base core; cerebers, brainstem and cerebellar tooth each account for approximately 10%.\\nThe brain deep wearing action can often be seen that small corneatotic aneurysms, high blood pressure cerebral outlets, including brain medium, deep wearing soybean artery (42%), basilar artery brain (16%), brain post-arterial hemp (15%), serving the cerebellar carotid core (12%), top pillow and temporal liprotenia branch (10%), etc. The blood is full of ventricular system and spider manetus; hemiphatocythane is often broken into the third ventricle or side chamber, and the endocette is damaged to the outside; brain bridge or cerebellar hemorrhage directly into the spider sheet or the fourth ventricle, non-high blood pressure cerebral hemorrhage Multi-cortex, common in brain amorphous vascular disease, arteriovenous deformity, Moyamoya disease, etc.\\n(2) See the pathological examination: bleeding side hemisphere swelling, congestion, blood flow into the gap or break into the ventricle; bleeding stove forms an irregular cavity, the center is filled with blood or purple grape slurry, surrounding is a bad dead brain tissue, Sold-specific hemorrhagic softening belt and obvious inflammatory cell infiltration, blood and swelling, brain tissue, edema, more edema, can cause brain tissue and ventricular shift, deformation and cerebrospheneous formation, mid-sphere bleeding, hematoma Extruded the lower portion of the hypothalamus, displacement, deformation, and secondary hemorrhage, often appear in small brain curtain, hypothalamus, and mid-stem, etc. Dry and small brain massive bleeding can occur in the pillow, the cerebral sputum is the most common causes of direct lethal deaths in cerebral hemorrhage.\\nAfter the acute phase, the blood clot is dissolved, phagocytic cells remove iron-containing blood-containing and necrotic brain tissue, gum hyperplasia, small bobbin forming a glue scar, and the bold cooker forms a stroke.',\n",

In the white matter around the lesion, the edema can also be inflammatory response, but the part is not necessarily corresponding to the lesion site. This period is clinically divided into a stove symptom, and there may be an endomic symptom, and can have cerebrospinal fluid Inflammatory change, etc.\\n2, PA\\nThe inflammatory lesions in the brain are further neat, liquefied, fused to form pus, gradually expand the formation of augant, according to the lesion or multi-housing or multiple anchor cavity, this stage has gliocyte proliferation or inflammatory The granulation structure is formed, the surrounding brain tissue can have an edema reaction, but the abscess wall has not yet been formed. Since the inflammation begins to limit the limitations, the symptoms of systemic infection have become better, but the spot shielding effect is also evident.\\n3, pyolum mask formation period\\nIn this case, the inflammation is further limited, that is, the envelope of the abscess, the inner layer of the envelope is mainly pus cells and denaturation white blood cells, and the middle layer is a fibrous tissue proliferated granulation tissue, the outer layer is gliocyte and gum fiber, early formation For the thin layer envelope, further gradually form a significant abscess package, abscess is monopoli, but can also be multi-room, multiple abscesses that are scattered in different parts, and the faster formation is slow depending on how many factors, such as pathogenicity Variety, toxicity, anti-vitamin reaction and power resistance of personal body, the part of the abscess, such as the ear stem cyclic abscess, the pathogenic bacteria, the bacteria, the golden staphylococcus, easy to form the film, formation time Also short, if the pathogenic bacteria is anaerobic bacteria, the envelope formation is more difficult, in addition, if the lesion is in the ventricle or brain dry, the condition has developed rapidly, the performance is also heavy, that is, the envelope has not yet formed, the condition is critical .\\nOnce the abscess is formed, it is a placeholder lesion, and there is a cerebral edema around the abscess. The placeholder effect causes the increasing intracranial pressure and the shift of brain tissue. With the development of the condition, if it is not treated, it can cause a small cerebral curtain or a pillow. Hernia, oppression brains and further intracranial pressure, resulting in sharp deterioration, or even death, and due to the gradual increase in pus, the purulent pressure is increased, which can cause the purulent cavity, spread the pus, causing suppurative meningitis Or suppurative ventritis, causing the disease, increase the treatment difficulty, brain abscess can also be combined with limitate mening membrane reaction, showing slurry meningitis, subaranitis, individual brain abscess can simultaneously combined with a pneumonium and (or) Hard film Exacerusal, etc.\",\n",

In this 14 years, From the perspective of 152 patients with compact, there were 143 cases (94%) of other organ tuberculosis patients; 142 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (93.4%) (including the primary tuberculosis nucleus); combined with liver spleen tuberculosis 62%, kidney tuberculosis 41%, intestinal and intestinal lymphatic tuberculosis approximately 24%.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nTuberculosis variable wave and mening membrane mainly pass the blood-cerebrospinal fluid pathway, the incidence of brain is related to the high degree of almight of the body, in addition, the brain can also cause the brain substance or meningica cheese stove, occasion of spinal, skull or murder The tuberculosis tuberculosis of the patterns directly spreads the meningum.\\nTesting mechanism\\nThe tuberculosis is a needle, the bacterial wall is rich in a variety of lipids, and the tuberculosis has a respiratory tract into the lungs, first forms a small area infection, because the bacteria is not borne enzyme or toxin without immunization or inflammatory response There is no symptom in the host, several weeks, bacilli invades the lymphatic system to enter the local lymph node, and blood-visualization from blood-visualization into the meantic membrane and the brain, including the chamber pipe film, and copy it.\\nWhen the host immune response is caused, T lymphocytes are sensitized to activate macrophages and move to infection stoves, macrophages can be swallowed and fused together to form multi-core vital cells (Langer Hans Giarocytes), at this time most bacilli This immune response is killed, and a small amount can still be left in macrophages, which is wrapped in an incomplete vesicle, and its volume is slightly in the meningum or the brain. .\\nWhen the host immune function is lowered or due to the old age, the tuberculosis in the lesion is activated into the subaracine under the lesion, and the spinal fluid is spread, and the tuberculous meningitis can cause tuberculous meningitis in a few days, and the inflammatory response can increase rapidly. However, the degree of hypersensitivity reactions caused by the antigenic substance of the bacterial walls have a certain relationship. The large amount of exudate produced by the inflammatory process is deposited in the brain bottom pool. The progress of the progress can cause subjunteitis, at which time fibroblasts. Entering exudate, meningum gradually proliferation, when affecting the absorption of the meningum to the cerebrospinal fluid can cause the carbon hydrophilic water, and if the bond is blocked due to adhesion, the fourth ventricular pore and the lateral hole can cause obstructive hydracene water.\\n2.

In recent years, the first place of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) has leapped the cause, and the proportion of infection and metabolic factors has declined by the early years, causing newborns The cause of convulsions are many, according to the category of 9, with the most common in the past 4 categories.\\n1, perinatal complications: Hie, intracranial hemorrhage, brain damage.\\n2, infection: various pathogens, encephalitis, brain abscess, infection, tethaal, tetanous, high heat.\\n3, metabolic factors: hypocalprid, hypognesium, hypoglycemia, high blood sodium, hypoglycemia, alkali poisoning, vitamin B6 lack of disease, nuclear jaundice, uremia.\\n4, cerebral obscurer: pulmonary transparent film disease, fetal suction syndrome, pulmonary hemorrhage, acute cardiocylastic cerebral ischemic syndrome, hypertension, red blood cell increase, heat syndrome.\\n5, the brain is abnormal: congenital brain development, intracranial malformation, intracranial tumor.\\n6, congenital enzyme defect: maple diabetes, urea circulating disorder, high-amine maternal, propionic acid, methylproliacidia, isochlorogenmia, galactide, vitamin B6 dependence.\\n7.

Drugs: stimulants, isoniazid, aminaptine, local anesthetic, organophos, withdrawal syndrome.\\n9. The reason is unknown: about 3% of the newborn convulsions.\\nIt is worth noting that some children can have multiple diseases at the same time, such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy can be combined with hypocalceramia, low magnesia or low sodiummia.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nThe incidence of neonatal convulsions is high, and its expressions are also very different from adults and children. It is still immature to develop nervous system in newborns, and is susceptible to various pathological factors. When the cerebral cortex is impaired, it is relatively related to Brain Stem Release Phenomen, and the neonatal cerebral cortex is related to the neonatal cerebral cortex. Cytoplashes are not complete, dendritic, synaptic, and myelin formation is not perfect, normal contact between neurons and neuropels has not yet been established, when abnormal discharge occurs, it is not easy to transfer and spread adjacent parts. It is not easy to spread to the opposite hemisphere to cause synchronous discharge, so the whole body's strong convulsions are rare.\\nThe convulsions need a group of neurons synchronous discharge, that is, the number of excited neurons needs to reach a certain threshold. The cell membrane of neonatal cerebral cortical neurons is strong, and sodium ions are easy to enter, and potassium ions are easy to leak, while film The sodium potassium pump function and the level of ATP are significantly lower than that of mature neurons, and the sodium ions are not easily and effectively pumped, and the relative high-poulated state is in a relatively high-poulated state, which is difficult to generate rapid repeat discharge and cause nearby neurons. Synchronous discharge, so neonatal cortical convulsions are relatively rare, sometimes only a few neurons discharge, not reaching thresholds that cause clinical convulsions, constitutes only EEG abnormal discharge without clinical convulsions.\\nNeonatal brain temporal lumens and monster, brain dry, marginal system, hippocampus, black, mesh activation system, etc. Under the stimulation of factors, it is easy to convulsion, showing the tiny tissue of paroxysmal, cheeks, eyelids, gaze, the abnormal movement of the eye, and autonomic episodes such as Sir, pupil, face, breathing, heart rate and blood pressure Changes, etc., the episode mechanism of epithelial seizures may be derived from the abnormal discharge of the gray in the cortex. This deep abnormally discharge, the head of the electrode can not be found; or the brain when the brain impairment is at a highly inhibited state. Dry release phenomenon, clinically 60% to 90% of the convulsion of patients with non-cortical abnormal discharge, the positive foundation of the electrocardiogram is helpless, no abnormal discharge cannot be negative.\",\n",

The neurophysiological reaction of hypoglycemia) or neuronal cell membrane changes (drug or alcoholism, epilepsy or acute head trauma).\\n1. Blood cycle and metabolism of the brain\\nThe brain is obviously dependent on continuous blood flow, transport oxygen and glucose, 100 g of brain tissue per minute is 3.5ml, the glucose consumption rate is 5mg, although the blood flow is lost 8 ~ 10S, it is lost, but the brain The sugar amount can provide 2 min energy after the blood flow is interrupted. When the hypoxia occurs on ischemia, the glucose available can be exhausted faster, and the cerebral blood flow (CBF) is 100g gray when normal. About 75 ml of minutes, 100 g of white matter is about 30 ml per minute (average of 100 g of brain tissue 55ml per minute).\\nLocal Autoregulation of cerebral blood (Local Autoregulation) can maintain an average of about 50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue, and 25 mmol of glucose is extracted in 50 ml of CBF, and oxidation is extracted from oxygen oxidation.\\nThe mechanism of normal CBF and brain metabolism does not understand, and the substance involving this mechanism is pH, adenosine (adenosine) and nitric oxide.\\nWhen hypoxia, the brain tissue is much smaller than ischemia, and the metabolic changes of glucose oxidation can be shown in the formula:\\nC6H12O6 → 6CO2 6H2O\\nThis reaction steps are two: glycolysis and oxidation of phosphorylation, and adult brain tissue can only use glucose, glycolysis begins with glucose phosphorylation, and then the hexagonal carbonate is divided into 2 tripropionic acid, dehydrogen lactate. The function of the enzyme is converted into acetone. This process is reversible, and the acetone can enter the mitochondria, which is oxidative metabolism, i.e., enter a tricarboxylic acid cycle.\\n2. Pathophysiology of white taline ischemic hypoxia\\n(1) Differences in white matter gray ischemic damage: gray oxygen deficiency causes a lot of excitatory glutamic acid, further open all glutamate gates, and some of the latter have some CA2 permeability, CA2 permeability channels Operating CA2 flows in a large amount of intracellular, activating the intracellular esterase, protease, and the like, and produces permanent damage to cells.\\nThe white matter does not have a synaptic of glutamic acid, so the ischemic membrane depolarization of the white matter does not cause glutamic media, but the Na continues to flow into the cell via a NA channel that is not inactivated due to lasting. The normal transmembrane Na gradient tile, Na gradient disappears and membrane depletion cause normal conditions to carry CA2 out of cells to exchange NA-CA2 exchange protein in reverse operation of CA2 internal flow, intracellular CA2 overload causes permanent damage And functional loss.\\n(2) γ-aminobutyric acid and adenosine effects: γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and adenosine are present in the white matter of the central nervous system, and there is no synapt in the white matter, so these neuroreactive materials are not Synailer is released, which is more likely to be released due to the reverse effect of Na and membrane potential dependent intake proteins.\\n(3) Discussion on the mechanism of action: In general, GABA and adenosine act on a completely different specific receptor to play intracellular effects, but in hypoxic white matter, GABA and adenosine appear to act on the same intracellular ingredient. It is necessary to produce protective effects, which is necessary for the GABA and adenosine generated by white matter.\\nThe extracellular sequential reactions were stimulated by GABA and adenosine molecules, thereby increasing cellular tolerance, GABA acting on GABA-β receptors, the latter coupled to intracellular protein kinase C (Protein Kinase) C, PKC), activated PKC transfers the phosphate to a variety of intracellular proteins, resulting in the latter function changes.\\nKOD and NA internal flow caused by white matter hypoxia damage, resulting in reverse openness of Na-CA2 operating protein, promoting CA2 into cells, hypoxia is also related to endogenous GABA, adenosine release, activated GABA-β The receptor and adenosine receptors activate the intracellular PKC, and the protein kinase C activation is constantly associated with the decision of the membrane operation protein via the G protein, and the PKC may reduce the oxygen white matter NA channel to affect the Na internal flow.',\n",

Each 100g brain tissue per 100 g of adults is 40 ~ 50ml. If it is reduced to 31.5ml, there will be cerebral ischemia symptoms, so it is necessary to ensure that normal cerebral blood flow is necessary, and normal people must flow through the brain in 24 hours. Around 1700L, oxygen consumption is about 72L, cerebral blood flow is closely related to effective perfusion pressure, cerebrovascular resistance, and is also related to intracranial pressure, blood viscosity, vascular diameter, etc.\\nCerebrovascular flow has changed with age, the state in which the body is in, for example, the cerebral blood flow increases when the body temperature is low, and the blood flow rate is reduced when the body temperature is lowered, but this cerebral blood flow fluctuation range is Limited, its cerebrovascular flow automatic adjustment function can obtain essential blood flow when the brain tissue is normal activity. Under normal circumstances, due to the automatic adjustment function of cerebrovascular, the changes in blood pressure does not affect cerebral blood flow, when blood pressure is increased Causes cerebrovascular resistance, causing cerebrovascular resistance to reduce cerebrovascular resistance, enabling cerebrovascular flow to maintain constant, cerebrovascular automatic adjustment function plays a large blood pressure fluctuation, when the average arterial blood pressure is less than 8 ~ 10.8kPa (60 When ~ 80mmHg), this kind of protective carbide flow is automatically adjusted, and some people block the alpha-adrenal adanence receptor in the experiment can reduce the lower blood pressure limit to 4.7kPa, so it is considered that the cerebral blood flow automatic adjustment function It is achieved by nerve domination, but other factors can affect cerebral blood flow, such as carbon dioxide and oxygen concentration in arterial blood, blood viscosity, vascular diameter, etc. If the cerebral blood flow stops 6 ~ 7min, the blood internal oxygen part pressure is lower When 2.7kPa, brain cells can occur due to normal oxygen metabolism, so severe brain functional disorders can occur.\\nRegarding the pathological physiology of syncope, it is believed that cerebral ischemia, the cerebral cortex and base core is first influenced on the highly sensitive state of hypoxia state, followed by the lower-looking Hill and Central brain, and the medullary brain bridge has a compassion. Large tolerance, according to this, it is believed that the first stage of the syncope, slow wave in the EEG, indicating that the brain's vocabulary - cortical level has hypoxic damage, and it can be seen in the clinical manifestation.

When there is a disease in the lower hypothalamus, regardless of the sequela of inflammation (such as meningitis, after encephabitis), trauma, tumor and other pathological changes, such as the intra-abdominal nuclear function, the abdomen nuclear function is relatively hycnostics, causing Obese; In addition, the area has a close anatomical connection with the higher level neuromati, and the latter can also perform a certain degree of regulation of the food. The blood-brain barrier in the hypothalamus is relatively weak, and the characteristics of this anatomy make a variety of bioactive factors in the blood to move to the place, thus affecting feeding behavior. These factors include: glucose, free fatty acids, norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-hydroxyamine, insulin, and the like. In addition, mental factors often affect appetite, the function of the bait center is subject to mental state, and when the spirit is too tight, the sympathetic interdenee or adrenergic nerve is stimulated (especially the α receptor dominant), appetite is inhibited; When insulin secretion increases, your appetite is absent. The inside of the intrauterine is the sympathetic neurons, and the abdomen is nuclear as a deputy-seniary nerve center. The two plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the nature.\\nIn recent years, high-insulinemia has attracted attention in obesity, obesity is often coexisting with high insulinmia, but it is generally considered to be obese. The insulin release amount of high insulinmiammia obesity is approximately three times the normal person, and the insulin has a significant promotion of fat accumulation. Some people think that insulin can be used as an indicator of overall fat, and can be used as an obese monitoring factor in a certain sense; more people think that plasma insulin concentration is significantly positively correlated with overall fat.\\nBrown adipose tissue has been discovered in recent years, which is corresponding to white adipose tissue mainly distributed around the subcutaneous and internal organs. The brown adipose tissue distribution is limited, only distributed between the shoulders, the neck, the armpit portion, the tissue and the kidney, and its tissue appearance is light brown, and the cell volume change is relatively small. White adipose tissue is in the form of storage, the body stores excess energy in neutral fat form, when the body needs, neutral fat hydrolysis, white adipocyte volume with interpretation and storage energy change Big. The brown adipose tissue is functionally a thermal organ, i.e., when the body is eating or being stimulated by cold, the fat cells are burned, thereby determining the energy metabolism of the body. The above two cases are respectively referred to as feeding in induced fever and cold induction. Of course, the function of this special protein is also affected by a variety of factors.

Inflammation and tissue damage are the results of a certain degree of repeated stress acting on a particular lost sensation. The pressure or shear force from the ground, shoes or other adjacent toes causes ulceration, due to the lack of normal neurope protection mechanism, the ulcer is often aggravated by the presence of bone processes. The lesion of the autonomous nervous system causes the normal sweating adjustment function, the skin temperature adjustment function and the loss of blood regulation, resulting in a decrease in the flexibility of local tissue, forming thickness and more crushing and cracking. In addition, the loss of normal perspiration capabilities blocks the renewal of local organizations, resulting in further damage, making deep tissue easier to plant bacteria. Sports neuropathy also plays a certain role in the incidence of diabetic foot, which is a typical claw toe deformity.

Sometimes dislocation, separation or bone embedding, bone membrane Adults are rare, but in the absence of infant vitamin C deficiency, due to bone film adhesion loose causes capillary hemorrhage, hemorrhage can be free, this bone film is most common, the bone is most common, the upper end of the femur, the upper end of the humerus, the tibia and the tibia In the junction of the middle ribs and ribs, the skin capillary is brittle, so that the split point, split and hematoma can cause the gum to be swollen, the tissue is fragile, and even because the sulphonia is absorbed, the teeth can be loose; Abnormal teeth is abnormal, the matrix forms very small, and is a sponge tooth.\\nThe main lesions are due to the lack of collagen caused by changes in bleeding and bones, and the primary component of the collagen is reduced, and chondroitin sulfate is reduced, and the collagen fibers form an obstacle, result The following lesions can occur: 1 Due to the impairment of connective tissue, there is a lack of binding mass between capillary endothelial cells to increase the brittleness and the permeability of the tube wall, and the bleeding of the skin, mucous membrane, the juvenile, the intramuscular bleeding, 2 bones Life: Most in the ribs cartilage connectivity and long bone end, especially near the wrist, knee and ankle joints, due to the formation of the matrix, osteoblasts can no longer form a normal cells in normal cells, cartilage ossipate obstacles However, the calcium calibration in the cartilage matrix continues, characterized in that the temporary calcification of the dry ends, forming a temporary calcification zone, which is densely thickened, and an osteogenic effect is suppressed, and the bone tissue has been formed. Easy, the end of the bone is fragile, often causes fracture and bone separation, the original cortical bone and pine bone cause a general bone atrophy due to internal absorption, the outer membrane is loose, and the bleeding is often visible to the bone membrane. 3 dental lesions: gums are congestion and edema, or the dental cell layer degraded, due to the lack of collagen, the teeth are loose, the gums are caused by gums, and the granulation is growing, and the lesion is often necrosis , Severe diseases may have skeletal muscle retreat, cardiac hypertrophy, bone marrow inhibition and adrenal shrinkage.',\n",

It has been continued to 2 to 3 weeks. On the one hand, low birth weights include premature infants and less glycogen and fat storage, on the other hand, on the other hand, the energy required for birth and metabolism is relatively high, and hypoglycemia is prone to hypoglycemia. It has been confirmed that the SGA child is relatively low, so that the glycogen is less synthesized, while some important organ tissue metabolism is relatively large. The amount of SGA's brain on glucose is significantly increased, and the ratio of brain weight and liver weight increase from normal 3: 1 to 7: 1, and the brain is 2 times the liver to the liver.\\nNewborns are severely ill, RDS, and hard, etc. are prone to blood sugar. These stress is often increasing with metabolic rate, hypoxia, body temperature and reducing. Hypoxia can cause hypoglycemia. Different hypoxia have different effects on sugar metabolism in full moon and premature infants, there is low blood glucose in newborns in Apgar scores, and it is full of full moon, because the stress is rapid, while Premature infants use glucose's ability. Domestic scholars have confirmed that newborns hypoglycemia in cold or low body temperature are high, and the heat-generating capacity of oligomators cannot meet the needs of body temperature regulation. The increase in sugar metabolic rate during neonatal infection, and the average glucose consumption rate increased by about 3 times more normal. Neonatal glycosyl isomogesene activity is low, while infection has increased the lack of glycogenosis, amino acids are not easily converted into glucose. Neonatal candied albums are mainly removed from brown fat, and when infection is serious, brown fat is exhausted, and the source of glycogen is interrupted, thereby low blood sugar. In addition, the patient's intake is reduced, and the digestive absorption function is reduced, and hypoglycemic is easily caused.\\nTemporary hyperinsulinemia is common in a baby with diabetes. Due to the high blood sugar of pregnant women, fetal blood sugar also increased, and hypoglycemia occurred from the mother's glucose. Severe hemolytic fetus due to erythrocyte destruction, red blood cells in the plasma can be used to effect on anti-insulin in plasma, and can also cause high insulinmia in the fetal islet B cells. Children with erythrocyte hyperviscular hypervisogenous blood, hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia can occur after hematopranium, due to high glucose concentration, stimulate insulin secretion, and short-term insulin levels after changing blood. Sustained high insulinmia includes islet cell adenoma, islet cell proliferation and Beckwith syndrome (characterized by weight, tongue, umbilical hernia and certain malformed with high insulinmia).\\nNeonatal neonatal neonatal is reduced by glucose in the blood of the lactose in the blood.

When the hormone is inhibited by feedback, the expression level of the pituitary ACTH is suppressed, the expression level of the chimeric gene is lowered, and the secretion of aldosterone is also lowered, so the exogenous dexamethasone can be more satisfactory to control the condition.\\n4. Primary Adrenal HyperPlasia, PAH: about 1% of the protocol, Kater, etc. found in 1982, 4 cases were found between APA and IHA, and their pathological form and IHA Similarly, it can be a single or bilateral adenoid with hyperplasia, but its biochemical change is similar to the APA, and the nature has a good reaction to the treatment of spironolactone, and the adrenal single or secondary resection can correct aldosterone excessive symptoms and biochemical abnormalities.\\n5. ALDOSTERONE-PRODUCING CARCINOMA, APC): It is a type of adrenol cortical carcinoma, accounting for 1% to 2% of the protocol, which can be found in any age, but More than 30 ~ 50 years old.\\nIn the literature, there is a type of ectopic aldosterone with adenoma and carcinoic aldeosterone producing adenoma and carcinoma. It is extremely rare, which can occur in the kidneys, adrenal residual tissue or ovary.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nRegardless of the alleged or type caused by the original aldehyde disease, the pathological changes are caused by a large amount of aldosterone in the amount of superbody, mainly high blood sodium, low blood potassium, renin-angiotensin system inhibition and alkali Poison.\\nThe aldosteone is the most important salt corticotonic hormone in the human body. Its main physiological effect is to promote renal distortion tubes and aggregate tubes to sodium ions and excreted with potassium ions. : 1 increase the absorption of sodium, decrease in urinary sodium discharge, sodium is \"positive balance\", in vivo sodium retention leads to the expansion of extracellular fluid, blood capacity increases; 2 Na concentration in the extracellular fluid increase, Na metastasis The sodium concentration in the vascular wall cell can increase the reaction of the tube wall to the blood-norepinephrine such as norepinephrine or the like, the sodium concentration of sodium in the pulseous muscle cells of the arterial angioplastic wall, causing the intracellular water retention, vascular wall swelling , The tightness of the lumen, the peripheral resistance increases, and high blood pressure is formed due to the synthesis of the above factors.\\nWhen blood sodium concentration increases and extracellular fluid expands to some extent, the intracellular pressure sensor is stimulated, atrial muscle dividend sodium (atriary sodium polypeptide Atrial natriureticPolypeptide, ANP), and heart sodium is a sodium, diuretic, Circulating hormones of blood pressure, its influence of sodium concentration and blood volume in blood, increased blood volume or increased blood volume increases to stimulate the intrinsic pressure receptor, so that the atrial muscle cells release heart sodium, sodium secretion Increased renal absorption of sodium sodium induced renal proximal tubes to increase the sodium ion concentration of the distal tube, so that the energy of the anexzolone is absorbed, and the sodium extortion is increased, thereby compensating for a large amount of aldosterone. Sodium Retention, so that the sodium metabolism reaches a near balance, no longer continuous sodium, thereby avoiding or reducing the malignant hypertension, edema, heart failure of the extracellular fluid further expansion, such as a large amount of aldosterone, kidney The effect of the small tube is dehydrate, and there is no longer continuing to have a sodium sodium, called the \"escape\" phenomenon of salt corticosteroids, and the heart of sodium can also inhibit the secretion of glomerular cell renin and adrenal aldolone. Secretance, and can resist blood angiotensin II (ATII).\\nThe potassium action of aldosterone is closely related to its sodium restraint, and aldosterone promotes the effect of kidney distortion small tube discharge potassium, which is affected by the concentration of the distal tube Na, the higher the content of the Na in the distal tube, and the urine k discharged Many, the content of Na in the neutron renal tube is reduced, and K secretion is reduced, and the k discharge in the urine is also reduced, so when sodium intake is reduced, the absorption of the nearla small tube is reduced, and the aldosteone is reduced. The potassium potassium action is significantly weakened, and the potassium discharge is a passive process. When the Na in the distal tubular cavity is heavily absorbed, the electrospheric liquid in the renal lumen is negatively laminated. At this time, in the tube cells The cationic k and h are filled with the urine discharge as the electrochemical gradient is secreted to the inner liquid in the small lumen and the protoxide patients have increased due to a large amount of aldosterone promoting the sodium of the distal tubule, and the excretion of the potassium also increases, urine A large amount of potassium, resulting in severe potassium lack of body, a series of nerves, muscles, heart, kidneys and pancreatic dysfunctions caused by potassium, and the excretion of potassium is not reduced by \"absorbing\", this is Since the sodium \"absorbing\" is reduced by the sodium absorption of the near-curved small tube, the sodium absorption is reduced in the distal tube, so the sodium recovery in the distal tube and Na -K exchange is not Change, potassium is still lost, so high blood sodium patients often do not obvious, but low blood potassium is very common, after loss of potassium ions, at this time, the extracellular fluid Na and H enter intracellular, Na and H ion is reduced by the performance of the cells, so that the intracellular Na and H have increased, and the extracellular fluid H is reduced, causing the end of the cellular liquid pH to decrease in blood, the pH of the extracellular liquid blood increases, and CO2CP increases alkalinemia.\\nWhen clinical is common from other reasons, such as anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, the Kidney tubular epithelial cell is reduced, so that Na -K exchange in the distal tube is reduced, Na -H exchange is increased, and diapers are acidic. Among the patients with protechanism, despite potassium lack of tubular epithelial cells, the Na -K exchange in the distal tubule is still promoted due to a large amount of aldosterone of sodium hydrazine, and Na -H exchange is suppressed, renal tubes. Cell secretion h reduces, the urine is not acidic, and is neutral, even alkaline or weak alkaline, so the intracellular liquid acidosis, extracellular fluid base poisoning and alkaline urine are characterized, base poisoning When the extracellular fluid is reduced, and the aldosterone promotes the pneumorate of magnesium to reduce blood magnesium, and the high blood volume of the original alternhematica patient has increased the excitability of the neighboring ball device of the horn, inhibits glomerular ball.

Adenomas can also occur in the stericity, thyroid or ectopellane.\\nParagraph adrenal hyperplasia\\nIn recent years, it has been found that the cases caused by the proliferation of primary cells have increased beforewards (about 15%). When hyperplasia, there is often a tiredness, irregular shape, no envelope, glandular, including changes in cyst, bleeding and necrotizing, and cell tissue is mainly a large water-like transparent cell, and there is fat cells. Formula envelopes are incorrectly adenned due to the compression of organizational compression around the hyperplasia zone.\\nParallel adrenal cancer\\nInvolved, blood vessels, and surrounding tumor cell infiltration, nuclear imaging, transfer, etc.\\n(2) bones\\nThe main lesions are increasing bone or osteoblasts, and bone absorption, with different degrees of osteopoly decalcium, connective tissue hyperplasia constitutes fibroblasts. In severe cases, multiple homocyclic lesions and \"brown tumors\" are severe, and the pathological fractures and malformations are prone to occur. Calcification in neonatal organizations. Skeletal lesion dominates with bone absorption is systematic. The bone disease is distributed in a bone, skull, mandible, spine and basin. Further, a change in osteosclerosis can also occur.\\n(3) Ectopic deposition of calcium salts\\nThe kidney is an important organ of the excretion of calcium salt, such as changes in urine concentration and acidity during excretion, and multiple urine stones can often occur. Calcium salt deposition can occur in renal tubules or interstitial tissues. In addition, calcium salt deposition can also occur within the blood vessels, skin, myocardium, etc. in the blood vessels, skin, myocardium.\\nPathogenesis\\nDue to excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone, calcium from the bone moving to the blood circulation, causing high blood calcium, and renal tubule reduces inorganic phosphorus researchers, increased urinary phosphorus, blood phosphorus decreases. Due to the autonomy of the tumor, the high blood calcium cannot inhibit the parathyroid, so blood calcium continues to increase, such as the renal function is intact, the amount of urinary calcium excretion increases to reduce blood calcium slightly, but continuous increased parathyroid hormone Causes a wide range of bone absorption, decomposition, bone substrate decomposition, mucin, hydroxyproline and other metabolic extracts increase, forming urinary stones or nephrocalcinosis, secondary infections and other factors The kidney can often suffer from severe damage. When the renal function is incomplete, the phosphate can not be sufficiently discharged, and the blood phosphorus concentration is reversed, while blood calcium can be reduced, but also stimulates the secretion of thyroid advent (there is a secondary function of tissue.

EBV in the early days, the EBV particles present in the non-malignant tissue cells were found to be the same as the EBV particles in the subsequent dummy cells, whereby the normal tissue cells may become abnormal cells after being infected by EBV, Cloning, resulting in evil group, domestic Liang Ping (1984) as an electron microscope observation on 8 cases of malodant, in 2 cases of evil group cells, considered that it is a virus A morphological mark of the role, some people have doubt that the disease is related to genetic factors, and there is a report of the father and son, and the domestic Guanmin, etc. (1990) reported 2 cases of my brothers, and there is another brother in their family. 3 brothers were in the infant period, the same condition was the same, and they were died within 3 months after the onset. In recent years, domestic scholars have found that the systemic lymphatic tissue in the evil corpse is severely shrinking. It is speculated that patients accompanied by immune function defects, as for immunodeflation is The cause is still no conclusion, in short, the cause is still unclear.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nAt present, in 1969, Rodman reported that 2 cases of evil group had chromosomes, namely T (2; 5) (P23; Q35), there were still 1 chromosome abnormality, Morgan, etc. found in 1986, 5 The chromosome long arm is a fixed point break (5q35 break), and is often accompanied by T (2; 5), and there is also a report No. 1, No. 3 and 6 chromosomes, Morris (1994), etc. T (2 (5) NPM / Alk fusion gene, shiota et al (1995) indicated that this fusion gene encodes a (80 kD) high-phosphorylated protein (P80), NPM / ALK fusion gene and P80 see all T (2; 5) In cases, it is possible to express P80 NPM / ALK, a separate disease, and the determination of cell genetics or P80 expression, 5Q35 faults can be used as a premise for diagnosis of CD30 positive tumors, domestic Wu Shiqi, etc. (1983) proposes D group 1 loss of chromosome is a relatively common nuclear type in this disease. In 1989 Stephen, three \"evil groups\" were reported, and Ki-1 (CD30) was expressed, and there were T (2; 5) (P23; Q35). It is believed that this translocation may be a group of diseases with evil group characteristics. In 1990, ABE has studied the cell genetics of 4 cases of evil group, of which 2 have an abnormal chromosome, breakpoint in short arm 13 (17p13), 7 cases of the review have also have the same abnormality found that there is already a high incidence of P53 gene mutation in human malignant tumors, and P53 (tumor suppressor gene) is positioned in chromosome short arms of 17. In 1992, domestic Tianhong et al. Conducted bone marrow chromosome analysis of 2 cases of evil group leukemoid type patients, and there was a three-body (1QTER-1P11) and 1P11 fracture translocation.',\n",
       " \"Human lymphoma confirmed that Burkitt lymphoma is associated with EB virus infection, and in this disease occurs mainly from 3 to 12 years old, it is related to certain climatic conditions, and can account for more than half of the local children's tumor, only 5%. The patient has more than 20 years old. Although there is also a patient in other parts of the world, it is a rare case. The genome of EB virus can be found in 98% of the Burkit lymphoma by cellular biology technology, but is distributed In Burkitt lymphoma, only 15% to 20% contains EB viruses, and the shell of anti-protected antibodies of EB viruses in the epidemic area, and the risk of such tumors in children with high titer and shell-resistant-positive positive is control group 30 Double, use EB virus infection, can cause hyperplasia to increase the disease with Burkitt lymphoma, and therefore, this disease is currently considered to be infection in infant and sustained EB virus infections, and immune function is inhibited. The cancer gene is activated, causing the consequences of malignant proliferation of B lymphocytes. At present, it is only a auxiliary factor infected with mosquitoes. The malaria infection changes the lymphatic network system, and the triggering cancer changes of the virus, B cells Infection is controlled by T lymphocyte, nucleopic (e.g., EBNA-2, EBNA-3) and membrane proteins (such as LMP-1) induces B cell proliferation.\\nEB virus infection in HD is also more common, but the relationship between the two is still unclear, EB virus infection is related to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and infectious monocytes, and there are many reports in the literature. Patients coexisting or occurring previously suffering from infectious mononuclear cells, and recent studies have found that 50% of the EB virus in 50% of the surface of the RS cells is found to be the shell RNA in the mixed cell type, because of the mixed cell type. The relationship between my country's lymphoma and EB viruses is also very valued. Due to the high infection zone for EB viruses, the EB virus in the normal population is high.\\nAnother important discovery is a virus caused by adult T cell lymphoma. It was also isolated from a mildren and et al. In 1987, the T cell leukemia lymphoma virus (HTLV-1) is called T cell leukemia lymphoma virus (HTLV-1) This is a very special anti-transcribe virus, the core is a single RNA, an outer envelope, a virus, a core protein, an envelope protein and a voxic enzyme and inverse enzyme 3 structural protein. After Gall et al., The AIDS virus (human acquired immunodeficiency virus, HIV) separated from French scholars Montagnier, has been isolated from tumor specimens of nearly 10 T cell lymphoma (HTLV) ), It is considered to be a highly specific virus. At the same time, Japanese scholars have found high-risk in southern and Kyushu, in the southern and Kyushu, in accordance with the epidemiological investigation of adult T cell lymphoma, peak in the south, in summer, patients are involved in agriculture, fisheries With forestry, there is often a factor such as tropical disease infection, and it is probably related to viruses and (or) infections, they also separate RNA viruses independently, called ATLV, after studying ATLV The same as HTLV, is also the pathogenic factor of adult T cell lymphoma / leukemia, but through a large number of serological studies, China's T cell lymphoma and HTLV-1 (or ATLV) have no affirmation. To date, China has only 4 cases. Cases related to HTLV-1 (or ATLV).\\nThe detailed mechanism of the virus causes the lymphoma is not fully understood that the replication of viruses is related to the generation of inverse activation factors (Tax), the latter induces the expression of the REL gene, enabling the cell proliferation, and needs to cause cell malignant transformation through other factors. Many people in high-risk districts infected HTLV-1, but only a few T cell lymphoma occurred, so that the host factors include genetic factors that may have certain important positions.\\nThe occurrence of lymphoma is closely related to immunosuppressiveness, due to organ transplantation, patients who take medicine for a long time, the incidence of lymphoma is significantly higher than that of ordinary groups, and there are more than 69% of the report. In addition, the central nervous is also far from high (28%) in general lymphoma (1%), and the immunosuppressive drug used has an effect on the occurrence of lymphoma, and the lymphoma is placed in a solution of cyclophosphamide. 26% of the original carcinoma, the earlier, while applying only 11% of the Mulan (azoxine) class, using a patient with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, lymphoma accounts for 64 of the second primary cancer %, Another fact that many primary immune defects and acquired immunodegenesis (AIDS) patients also prone to lymphoma and other tumors, especially patients with EB virus infection, lymphoma occur Higher rate.\\nIn recent years, there has been reported that gastric Helicobacter pylori (HP) can not only lead to chronic gastritis, gastric cancer, but also cause high hair of gastric lymphoma, and some patients can shrink by lymphoma after antibiotic treatment, and some authoritative organizations, such as NC-CNs, in recent years. In the treatment specifications, antibiotics have been used as the preferred method of mucosa-associated lymphoma (MALT), which is the first example of antibiotics to treat tumors.\\nIn the early years, the Chinese and Western farmers have reported that the lymphoid incidence is higher than the normal population due to the use of pesticides and pesticides; the US Navy has been engaged in the oil paint ribroom and the retired veterans who have contacted fluoroa have also high, but very It is difficult to indicate that the mechanism is more affirmative that the atomic bomb victims have received 1Gy-radiant Hiroshima residents and patients who have been treated with spondylitis. The incidence of lymphoma is 2 times higher than that of normal populations, and it has received radiation in clinical practice.

There are several assumptions that HLA-B27 and spinal articulation:\\n1HLA-B27 acts as a receptor site of infection factors;\\n2HLA-B27 is the earth change of the immune response gene, which determines the susceptibility to environmental excitation factors;\\nThe 3HLA-B27 can be reacted with foreign antigen to induce tolerance to abuting antigen;\\n4HLA-B27 enhances neutral leukocyte activity, free monoclonal antibody, cytotoxic lymphocytes, immuno electrophoresis and restricted fragment length multi-morphism, currently determined that HLA-B27 is about 7 or 8 kinds Subtype [1], HLA-B27 positive health people may have genetic differences, such as all HLA-B27 individuals have a constant HLA-B27M1 antigen determinant, antibodies for this antigen determinant can be used with HLA -B27 cross-reactive, most HLA-B27 molecules also have M2 antigen decisions, and HLA-B27M2 negative molecules seem to have more links to other HLA-B27 subtypes and AS, especially Asian, and HLA-B27M2 positive Asia It may have been enhanced to Reiter syndrome, which has been proven that HLA-B27M1 and M2 two antigen decisions and demonstration factors of Saukre Bacillus, Cristacus and Narsonnee cross-response, reaction It seems to be AS, and the reactive reinforcer has developed into reactive arthritis or Reiter syndrome.\\n2, infection: In recent years, it has been suggested that the incidence of AS may be associated with infection. In the event period of the intestinal pneumonia, the carbone of the gestone, the tight of the bacteria is high, and the control group is high, and The condition activity is positively correlated, and some people increase Krebaccompine and HLA-B27 may have cross-reactions or common structures during antigenic disability, such as HLA-B27 (host antigen residues 72 to 77) and pulmonary Bacillus (residual) Base 188 to 193) It has homologous oxycase sequences, and other Gram-Yin Physicia have antibodies with this synthetic peptide sequence, and HLA-B27 positive AS patients have 29%, while the control group is only 5% [[ 15], Mason, etc. It is much higher than that of ordinary people, so it is speculated that AS may be related to infection. Romonus believes that the pelvic infection is spread to the ankle joint, and then spread through the spinal venous plexus to the spine, but in the lesion site failed to find infection ( Bacterial or virus).\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nThe cause of AS is not fully clarified. In recent years, molecular mimicry has been comprehensively interpreted from different perspectives, and epidemiological surveys combine immune genetic studies. HLA-B27 is in ankylosing spondylitis. The patient has more than 90%, which proves that AS is related to genetics. Most scholars believe that they are related to genetics, infections, immunization, environmental factors, and the like.\\n1, genetic: genetic factors have an important role in the incidence of AS, according to epidemiological surveys, the HLA-B27 positive rate of AS patients is as high as 90% ~ 96%, while the HLA-B27 positive rate of ordinary populations is only 4% to 9%; HLA-B27 positive AS is about 10% to 20%, while the incidence of ordinary population is 1% ~ 2%, with a phase difference of about 100 times, there is a report, and the risk of AS in patients with AS patients is higher than the average person. 20 ~ 40 times, the prevalence of the first-level relatives in patients with AS patients was 24.2%, the normal population was 120 times higher than the normal population, and the HLA-B27 positive health, the relatives of the relatives occurred as the HLA-B27 positive AS patients with low, All of these have explained that HLA-B27 is an important factor in AS morbidity, but it should be seen that on the one hand, the HLA-B27 positive is not all spine joint disease, on the other hand, about 5% ~ 20% Spinal joint patient detection of HLA-B27 is negative, prompting other factors, there are other factors affecting AS, and HLA-B27 is an important genetic factor in AS expression, but does not affect this disease. On the only factor, there are several assumptions that can explain the relationship between HLA-B27 and spinal articulation:\\n(1) The HLA-B27 acts as a receptor site of infection factors.\\n(2) The HLA-B27 is a marker of the immune response gene and determines the susceptibility to environmental excitation factors.\\n(3) The HLA-B27 can be cross-reacted with foreign antigens, thereby inducing tolerance to abuting antigens.\\n(4) HLA-B27 enhances neutrophil activity.\\nWith a monoclonal antibody, cytotoxic lymphocyte, immuno electrophoretic and restricted fragment length, it is currently determined that HLA-B27 has about 7 or 8 subtypes, and HLA-B27 positive health people may have inheritance. Differences, for example, all HLA-B27 positive individuals have a constant HLA-B27M1 antigen determinant, and antibodies for this antigen determinant can be cross-reacted with HLA-B27, and most of the HLA-B27 molecules also have M2 antigen determinants. The HLA-B27M2 negative molecules seem to have more strong linkages than other HLA-B27 subtypes, especially the Asian, HLA-B27M2 positive subtypes may increase the susceptibility to Reiter syndrome, which has been proven that HLA-B27M1 is M2 two antigen determinants, and the insanctia factor such as Kareb bacteria, Cristifier and Yersin bacilli can cross-react, and the lower response seems to be AS, and the reaction reinforcer has developed into reactive arthritis or Reiter syndrome.\\n2, infection: Research suggests in recent years, the incidence of AS may be associated with infection, discovery AS patients in the carry rate and serum of the genus of the gestone in the AS activity during the AS activity period and the IgA type antibody titer for the bacteria is more compared The set is high, and it is positively related to the condition activity. Some people have proposed Karebylis and HLA-B27 may have an antigen residue cross-reaction or a common structure, such as HLA-B27 host antigen (residue 72 to 77) and pneumonian Rebury (residue 188 ~ 193) has a homologous amino acid sequence, and whether other Gram-negative bacteria have the same sequence, unclear, immunochemical analysis found that HLA-B27 positive Reiter syndrome is about 50% of serum antibody In combination with this synthetic peptide sequence, HLA-B27 positive AS patients have 29%, while only 5% of the control group, according to statistics, 83% of male AS patients with prostatitis, some scholars found about 6% ulcerative Patitis patients with colitis, other reports also confirmed that ulcerative colitis and limitations of ulcerative colitis and limit enteritis in AS patients were much higher than that of ordinary populations, so it was speculated that AS may be related to infection.\\n3, Other: Some people found that 60% of the patients with serum complement level increased, most cases have IgA type rheumatism, serum C4 and IgA levels have significantly increased, serum cyclic immunochin, but antigen nature is not determined, or more Phenomenon, the immune mechanism participates in the disease, trauma, endocrine, metabolic disorder and metamorphosis, etc. The influence is influenced by environmental factors (including infection).\\n4, pathology: The disease pathology characteristics of the disease is different from rheumatoid arthritis. The basic pathological changes are tendons, and the ligament is attached to the nectic change, and a certain degree of synovia, often in the first disease, after the ankle joint Joint adhesion, fibrous and osteoarthria, histological changes are chronic inflammation of joint capsules, tendons, ligaments, with lymphocytes, slurry cell infiltration, these inflammatory cells are distributed around smaller synovial blood vessels There can also be chronic inflammatory lesions in adjacent bone tissues, but the lesion of the inflammatory lesion is independent of the lesion of the synovial membrane, the different points of the pathological changes of this disease and rheumatoid arthritis are, joints and joint tissues, ligaments, intervertebral discs. There is a significant calcified trend with the ring fiber tissue. The histological changes of the surrounding synovitis of the disease are different from rheumatoid arthritis. The synovitis cell cells are lymph in the IgG type and IgA type. There are more cells and can be seen in macrophages that swallow the denatured polynuclear cells, and the synovial inflammation has rarely erosion and deformity changes.\\nThe ankle arthritis is a pathological logo of ankylosing spondylitis, and is often one of its earliest pathological performance. Early pathological changes in ankle arthritis include the formation of cartilage granulation, histone synovial hyperplasia and lymphoid cells And slurry cell aggregation, lymphoid filter formation, and slurry cells containing IgG, IgA and IgM, bone erosion and cartilage destruction, and then gradually returned fiber soft bone substitute, and finally bone is strong, spinal The initial damage is the granulation structure of the intervertebral disc fiber ring and the edge of the vertebral joint. The outer layer of the fiber ring may end up with the bone, forming a ligament, further development will form the X-ray spine and other damage to the spine including Diffuse osteoporosis, vertebral disorder of adjacent intervertebral discs, vertebral cooles and intervertebral disc hardened, other spine artisan can also be observed to observe similar mid-axial articotic changes.\\nThe peripheral pathology of ankylosing spondylitis showed synovial hyperplasia, lymphoid infiltration and blood vessel formation, but there is no common synovial fluff in rheumatoid arthritis, fiber deposition and ulceration formation, in ankylosing spondylitis, cartilage meat buds Tissue hyperplasia often causes cartilage damage, and other chronic spine joint diseases can also be seen similar synovial pathology, but the early lesions of Wright syndrome highlight more significant polygonal white cell infiltration.\\nTendon enditis is another pathological sign of spine joint disease, is inflammation that occurs in the part of the bone in the ligament or tendon, which occurs around the spine and pelvic, which may lead to osteogenation, in other spine joints Outside the disease is more common, the latest studies have shown that the unsatisfactory cartilage destruction of ankylosing spondylitis is mainly developing from the inflammation of the bone, tendon and the inflammation of the bone joints (from the inside outward) And rheumatoid arthritis is mainly started by synovitis, and gradually occur in cartilage and cartilage bone failure (developed in the outer direction).',\n",

Because alcohol is metabolized in liver tissue, the blood concentration is placed, so that the blood concentration has been proximately saturated uric acid, accelerates into soft tissue to form crystallization, resulting in excessive reaction of the body immune system (sensitive) causes inflammation. The gout is known as the \"The Disease of the King\", so the symptoms are good in the hands of the people, such as the Yuanshu Zu Dubei, who is suffering from gout because of drinking alcohol.\\nGout can be triggered by diet, weather changes such as temperature pressure mutation, trauma. Some foods have metabolized, some of which can cause the original savings of uric acid crystals to be re-dissolved in soft tissue, which can also be induced and aggressive.\\nThe long-term growth of uric acid in the blood is a key reason for gout. Human uric acid is mainly derived from two aspects: (1) Nucleic acid and other purine compounds produced in human intracellular protein and other purine compounds, resulting in endogenous uric acid by the effect of some enzymes.\\n(2) The purine compound, nucleic acid and nucleic acid ingredient contained in the food, after digestion and absorption, exogenous uric acid is generated by some enzymes.\\nThe generation of uric acid is a very complicated process that requires some enzymes, which can be roughly divided into two categories: promoting uric acid synthesis, mainly 5-phosphate-1-pyrophosphate synthetase, adenine phosphate nucleoside Acid transferase, phosphoric acid rhythmic prapamide transferase and xanthin oxidase; enzymes inhibiting uric acid synthesis, mainly hypoxantine-guanine nucleoside transferase. Gout is due to various factors, such as the activity of these enzymes, such as promoting the activity of uric acid synthetase, inhibiting the activity of uric acid synthetase, etc., resulting in too much uric acid, or due to various factors, kidneys, uric acid disorders To make uric acid accumulate in the blood, produce hyperuricemia.\\nHigh uric acid, as long-term, uric acid will deposit in the form of joint, subcutaneous tissue and kidney in the form of uric acid, causing a series of clinical manifestations such as arthritis, subcutaneous gout stones, kidney stones or painful nephropathy.\\nThis disease is the recurrent acute or chronic arthritis of the outer peripheral joint. It is caused by the crystallization of single sodium uurine salt in the body fluid in the joint, tendon and its surrounding deposition due to supersaturated hyperuricemia.\\nPathogenesis\\nUric acid decomposition decreases as a mechanism that causes hyperuricemia has been excluded. During the normal conversion of nucleic acids and nucleotides, partially degraded into a ruthenyl group, mainly hypoxanthine and guanine. When the nucleic acid required for synthesis of nucleotides, it will be quickly degraded into sub-xanthine, guanine, and the uricine is oxidized to uric acid in the melanoxidase. .呤 nucleotide, adenine nucleotides, hypoxantine nucleotides, and guanine nucleotides are end products of sputum biosynthesis. The above three kinds of purine nucleotides can be synthesized directly from the purine base; such as guanine is converted into a cerne nucleotide, and the secondary xanthine is converted into a sub-xantine nucleotide, adenine transformation. Getting adenine nucleotides, or they can be recombined. The first step of purine metabolism and its feedback inhibition are phosphoric acid rhyogant phosphate (PRPP) + glutamine + H2O aminophosphate + glutamic + pyrophosphate (PPI), the reaction is transfected from a phosphate coated Catalytic.\\nThis reaction adjustment is out of control and increased hydrazine synthesis: PRPP, glutamine concentration increases; the amount or activity of the enzyme is increased, and the sensitivity of the feedback inhibition of the enzyme is lowered, and adenosine is coordinated by the enzyme activity The concentration of acid or lens is reduced, resulting in a decrease in inhibition of the enzyme; when the Lack of HPRT lack and PRPP synthetase is excessively active, the concentration of intracellular PRPP has increased significantly, and the synthesis of purine is increased. Patients with increase in uric acid, the conversion of PRPP is accelerated. In addition, the reason for some hyperuricemia is caused by the lack of hypoxantine-guanine phosphate converter (HGPRT). When the enzyme is abnormal, the PRPP increases, and the synthesis of purine is increased, and uric acid is increased. Other processes include any process that leads to intracellular adenylate decomposition acceleration, which will increase uric acid due to increased uric acid, causing hyperurice.\\nFor some gout patients, the direct pathological mechanism of hyperuricemia is a decrease in the clearance rate of the renal tube to uric acid, and the excretion of the kidney to uric acid is filtered by glomerular, but filtered uricate Almost completely composed of near-curved tubules (secreted forward absorption); kidney-secreted uricate moieties are also heavily absorbed at the distal end of the nearla small tube, and a small amount is absorbed in Henry and aggregate tube (secretion after heavy absorption). Therefore, uricate excretion is almost secreted by the renal tubule, and the final uric acid excreted from the kidney is 6% to 12% of the glomerular filtration. When the gliferous uric acid salt is filtered, the renal tube is reduced to uric acid, and the decrease of uuridate in the renal tube is reduced, which can cause decrease in uric acid salt renal excretion, resulting in hyperuricemia. When the increase of blood uric acid exceeds the supersaturated concentration, the uric acid is deposited in tissue, which has confirmed that the secretion of uric acid in the noodles of the gout patients decreased.',\n",

The family tendency, genetic model is unclear.\\nPathogenesis\\nRegarding the pathogenesis of gout arthropathy, many scholars generally believe that the uric acid chloride tissue and joint cartilage released by the gout, the chloride crystals released by the arthrotene, and the white blood cell is destroyed to release the protease and inflammatory factor. Enter the slider, the enzyme inflammatory factor increases the white blood cell in the joint, and there is more phased-free cyclosis of uric acid salt crystals to release the enzyme and the inflammatory ingredient, forming a malignant circulation, further leading to acute synovitis and joint cartilage Destruction, uric acid concentration in tissue is very low, especially when the pH of the body fluid is low, when the blood uric acid concentration exceeds 80 mg / L, that is, there is uric acid salt deposition, the common portion is the joint capsule, cartilage and bone ribs, It can also be found in the kidney and subcutaneous connective tissue, and the local accumulation is too much, it forms a gout stone.',\n",

Through immunohistochemistry, it is confirmed that the wind and humid heteropathy is mainly infiltrated by T lymphocyte, and there is lymphocyte reaction in blood circulation in rheumatic hot patients and a series of cellular immune response markers, such as interleukin (IL-1, IL). - 2) However, the peripheral blood and cardiac tissue cells promote the activity of probaches, and the cellular immunization plays an important role in the process of rheumatism.\\n(2) Virus infection: In recent years, students have more concerned about viral infection, and believe that rheumatism can be associated with Coxak B3, B4 virus infection, which is:\\n1 In some wind and heart disease patients, Koxaki B3, B4 antibody titration is significantly increased.\\n2 The left house and the heart valve have been found on the left, and the heart valve.\\n3 When Java monkey is infected with Carka B4 virus, it can produce a pathological change of wind and heart disease, but this study has not been universally accepted, and it is difficult to explain penicillin to have significant effect on preventing rheumatism, and many scholars believe that viral infection It is possible to create conditions for the crest infection infection, from the cause of the rheumatic heat generation process.\\n(3) Genetic factors: Recently, there is a genetic mark in rheumatoid patients, using a serum called 883 B cells, about 72% of rheumatic heat, is positive, targeting B cells The antigen has also produced monoclonal antibody D8 / 17, 80% to 100% of acute rheumatic heat, and only 15% positive in the control group, so it is possible to use monoclonal antibody to screen acute rheumatic thermal and easy people, by immunization Genetics research, discovery of rheumatism and heat patients and their relatives, there are special antigenically expressions in their immune system, and most reports are increasing with HLA-DR4, and there are also frequencies in HLA-DQAL and DQB1. The progress of the study is likely to find rheumatism and patients in the vast groups to perform targeted prevention, most scholars believe that genetic factors can be used as one of the susceptibility factors, but the same family, the most likely causes It is also related to the same life environment and is easy to infect.\\n(4) Immune function: Changes in immune function may also participate in rheumatic heat, often have immunoglobulin IgG, IgA and Igm increase in rheumatism and rheumatism; although there is increased white blood cells in blood, its phagocytic ability is reduced The lymphocyte transformation test results show that lymphocytes are reduced to the original lymphocyte conversion, indicating that there is a cellular immune function defect, and the cell-mediated immune response is also important in this disease.\\nAs for malnutrition, the relationship between trace elements and rheumatism (currently found that there is a close relationship between zinc and rheumatism and wind and heart disease), endocrine disorder, etc., continuing to explore, in short, rheumatism Complex, it is the result of the common effects of the constraints of streptivobaclasopharyngeal infection and body immune status.\\n2. Pathology\\nRheumatic heat is systemic connective tissue inflammation, which can be divided into three phases depending on the process of lesions.\\n(1) Severe permeation period: Channing tissue split, swelling, swelling, forming glass sample and cellulose-like sputum, derived lesion with lymphocytes, slurry cells, eosinophils, neutralized cells and other inflammatory reactions Infiltration, this issue can last for 1 to 2 months, restore or enter the second and third phase.\\n(2) Proliferation: A rheumatic granuloma or rheumatoid small body, which is a rheumatoid fever, and the index of rheumatism, a rheumatoid activity, and a rheumatic activity of pathology, small There is a cellulose sample in the center of the body, and the edges are lymphocytes and slurry cells infiltrated, and rheumatoid cells, rheumatoid cells are circular, elliptical or polygon, and the cytoplasm is abundant. Nuclear benevolence, sometimes dual-core or multi-core to form a giant cell, and enter the hardening period, this period can last for 3 to 4 months.\\n(3) Hardens: The denaturation necrosis of the rheumatoid small body is gradually absorbed, the inflammatory cells of the oozing are reduced, and the fibrous tissue hyperplasia is formed in the granuloma site to form scar tissue.\\nSince the disease is often repeated, the development process of the above three phases can be interleaved. It takes 4 to 6 months, and the first period and the second phase are often accompanied by slurry exudation and inflammatory cell infiltration. This exudative lesion is changed. To a large extent, the development of various symptoms in the clinical symptoms is large, and the pathological changes in joints and cardiac packages are mainly oozing, and the formation of scars is mainly limited to endocardios and myocardium, especially valve.\\nRheumatic hot inflammatory diseases and collagen fibers of systemic connective tissue, early in the early stage and heart are more accusation, and then the heart damage is mainly, the disease has focused on the incidental organs, such as the joint and heartbase , Forming arthritis and cardiac inflammation, after which the oozing can be completely absorbed, and a few pericardial lease is absorbed, the polarization is partially adhesive, and the intracellular milder is mainly proliferative lesions, and it is subsequently formed by scar proliferation, heart valve Proliferative lesions and adhesions often lead to chronic rheumatic heart valve disease.',\n",

       " \"Most complement genetic defects are commonly dyed, and a few are commonly stained with normally, and prepared defects are the X-chromosome chain hidden inheritance.\\nAccording to genetic characteristics, complement hereditary defects can be divided into 4 categories: homozygous genetic defects, hybrid genetic defects, complement protein dysfunction and complement defects caused by homogeneous profiles, and homozygous genetic defects, the complement ingredients are completely Lack, often behave without CH50 activity, while other complements are normal; the level of complement lack of heterozygous patients is half the normal level, and the CH50 is also half the normal level, while other complement ingredients are normal; complement protein dysfunction The completion level in the blood is within the normal range, sometimes even higher, but the complement protein function is very low; the complement of the same shaped genetic defect is usually a commonly stained ingenuity, and the complement defect can also be divided into complete Defects and partial defects, due to the adjustment characteristics of complements and the correlation between their structures.\\nClinically, although most cases are significantly reduced or detected in most cases, while other complement levels are normal, there are some exceptions, such as in homozygous C1R defects, the concentration of C1s also decreases. Some patients with C2 defects are accompanied by B factor levels, which is due to the highly structural homology of complement proteins and secondary lack of complement proteins, additional b factors and C2 genes in chromosome The upper position is very similar, so it has similar adjustment mechanisms, and in the hereditary vascular neurological edema (HAE), the level of C4 and C2 decreases, the I factor and the H factor defect decreases, respectively, respectively. Due to excessive activation of classics and bypass routes, due to lack of complement ingredients to cause damage to the classic and (or) bypass system function and antibody response to T cell-dependent antigens, the patient has prolonging or immunogenic composites for viral infection. There is a time extension in the cycle.\\nHereditary C1 defects:\\nThere are two kinds of hereditary C1Q defects, and a hereditary C1Q defect is due to can't synthesize C1Q (accounting for 60%), and therefore, the antigenicity of C1Q does not measure the antigenicity of C1Q; another C1Q defect is due to the synthesis of function. C1Q molecules (accounting for 40%), thus detecting antigenicity of C1Q, but C1Q function disorder, causing C1Q function defects, C1Q consists of 6 copies of any of A, B, and C3 chains, The study believes that C1Q defects are often due to can't synthesize the B chain, and C1R and C1S defects are very suitable.\\nAlmost all patients with C1 defects have immunized composites. Common people are systemic lupus or disc lupus or glomerulonephritis. Patients with few heredible C1 defects can be associated with severe bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, meningitis. The disease caused by the sepsis caused by Golden Squin, but there is no clinical manifestation, and the occurrence of immunocellular disease is due to the deposition of C1 defects, resulting in deposition of the immune complex in the tissue site, determination of serum C1 level Can diagnose, in SLE patient, when other clinical disease activities are improved, there is still a sustained CH50 reduction, it should be considered that there is a possible possible.\\nHereditary C2 flaws:\\nHereditary C2 flaw is the most common hereditary complement defect in the white, and the incidence of approximately 1/00,000, about 40% of heterozygous C2 complex defects have SLE, and the study of SLE, SLA-DR2 And the occurrence rate of DR3, the patient in the blood of the hereditary C2 defect with SLE does not affect the anti-nuclear antibody and anti-DSDNA antibody or the titer is extremely low, the nervous system is increasingly damaged, but the skin and the joint performance are obvious. It is often difficult for clinical diagnosis SLE, and the MHC mark of C2 defects has high restrictions. Most C2 invalid gene C2QO is located in HLA-A25 (A10), B18, BFS, C2Qo, C4A4, C4B2 and DR2 haplistics. Almost all of these genes exist at the same time, suggesting that C2 defect patients have a complete haploid type, and the existing C2 defective haplotypes are all these original mutations derived.\\nAt present, C2 defects have been known, often repeatedly caused by pneumonia, meningitis or bacteremia, HLA-A and HLA-B gene, HLA-A and HLA-B gene, HLA-A and HLA-B gene, HLA-A and HLA-B gene, and antigenic identification The HLA-D gene is associated with the immune response of the HLA-D gene and the immune response of soluble antigen, and the gene cross-a and HLA-B and HLA-B and HLA-D and HLA-DR in 1%, and some people think that C2 is considered. Patients with defects are susceptible to infectious diseases, but there is no clinical manifestation in some C2 defects.\\nHereditary C3 flaws:\\nThere are three types of hereditary C3 defects, and a patient's C3 gene is a non-active gene or a C3 gene function to cause a C3 function defect; the other is C3 defect with hereditary 3B inactivated C3b INA defects, and cannot make C3 lysis Inactivation, the C3B and B factor interactions in C3c and C3D are inactivated, and the positive feedback regulation of the bypass activation system is further consumed, referred to as excessive decomposition, Type I, C3B inactivation; There are some cyclic factors containing cleavable or activating C3 in serum, causing C3 defects (excessive decomposition II), and hereditary complement C3 defects continue to regulate protein I factors, H factor defects, and some patients can also be accompanied by Glomerulonephritis or vascular inflammation, but there are also a few patients may have no symptoms, and C3 defective patients are hindered by the conditioning of pathogens, which is impaired by dissolving C5A's phagocytosis and dissolved cells of membrane attack composites. , Often repeated pneumonia, bacteremia or peritonitis, pathogenic bacteria often is gold-yellow Staphylococcus, pneumococcal and naphturium, etc., clinically found that some C3 defective patients with membrane proliferative glomerulonephritis, hematuria or protein Urine, etc., it is considered that C3 defects are related to a substance called C3 nephritis, and the C3 nephritis is now determined to a specific IgG antibody of a new antigen on a anti-C3BBB complex, which has a stable C3bbb active type.\",\n",

Based on the pneumoniae, the fluoride, the germiothyllococcal, the molamilica and the Staphylococcus aureus occurred, and the bacterial infection occurs on the basis of damage to the virus or mycoplasm infection.\\nPatients with wheezing chronic bronchitis, have more sensitive history, and the positive rate of skin tests excited to multiple allergens is also high, and the number of eosinophils and histamine content and IgE in sputum have increased trends, some patients Serum rheumatoid factor positive and T lymphocyte subpopulations are abnormal, so it is considered that special stress (atopy) and immunity factors are related to this disease, but it also believes that special quality should be asthma, such The patient actually belongs to asthma or chronic bronchitis combined with asthma.\\nChronic bronchitis acute epitracipitation is more in winter, so meteorological factors should be seen as one of the important factors of the disease, cold air can stimulate the increase in mucus and the degree of ciliary movement, and the defensive function of the airway can also cause bronchial bumps by reflection. Smooth muscle spasm, mucous membrane contraction, local blood circulation disorder, is conducive to secondary infection, most patients have autonomous neurological disorders, some patients have a high degree of hyperthermition, and the airway reactivity is higher than normal. In addition, the elderly adrenal adrenal Cortical functional decrease, damage to cellular immune function, low lyse activity, low nutrient, vitamin A, C deficiency, etc., can increase the increase in airway mucosa vascular permeability and epithelial repair function, whether genetic factors are related to chronic bronchitis There is no exact evidence so far.\\nUnder normal circumstances have a perfect defense function, the effect of filtration, heating and moisture can be used to increase the inhalation of air; the ciliary movement and cough reflection of the airway mucosa, thereby removing foreign matter and pathogenic microorganisms in the airway, The lower respiratory tract also has a secreted IgA, and there is an anti-pathogenic microorganism. Therefore, the lower respiratory tract can generally maintain the purification state, the whole body or the partial defense and immune functional reduction, especially the elderly, it is easy to suffer from chronic bronchitis, and Repeated attacks without increasing.\\n1, the elderly human gland and adrenal cortex, the larynge reflection is reduced, the respiratory defense function degradation, mononuclear-phagocytic cell system can decline, can also increase chronic bronchitis.\\n2, nutrients also have certain effects on bronchitis, vitamin C deficiency, the body's resistance to infection, increased vascular permeability; vitamin A deficiency, the columnal epithelial cells of bronchial mucosa and muclease can be reduced, and lyse enzyme activity Reduce, susceptible to chronic bronchitis.\\n3, whether the genetic factor is related to the incidence of chronic bronchitis, has not been confirmed so far, and the severe deficiencies of α1-anti-suplasses can cause emphysema, but the symptoms of non-airway lesions have suggested it is not directly related to chronic bronchitis.\\nPathogenesis\\nBronchial mucosal epithelial cell degeneration, necrosis, even fall off to form ulcer, short variation, unevenness, poured, partially complete loss, all levels of bronchiostal inner division retention, relieve mucosal epithelial repair, epithelial layer thin, hyperplasia, Squam-like epithelial and granuloma formation, the number of cup-shaped cells increases hypertrophy, the ratio of cilia can be 1: 2 (normal 1: 4 ~ 5), secrecy, substrate film becomes thick or denial, necrosis, bronchostate gland Body hyperplasia, the thickness of the gland and the thickness ratio of the bronchi wall is often> 0.55 ~ 0.79 (normal <0.4), the number of mucinous adenomas is significantly increased, and the slurry gland can be converted into a mucous glands, mucinate hypertrophy, shape It is irregularly with secretions, which can also be seen in the lymphatic tissue of the hyperplasia of the hyperplasia.\\nVarious inflammatory cells in the bronchial walls at all levels, which are symmented by the cytoplasm, lymphocytes, sometimes visible eosinophils, and the acute episode can be seen in a large number of neutral granulocytes, mucosa epithelial acute cardiy, severe, The bronchi wall charges, edema, more high secretions, multiple bronchitis repeated acute episodes, lesions can be topped, gradually volatilized to fine bracudial, tube wall inflammatory cell infiltration, congestion edema, mucosa denaturation necrosis and ulcer formation, Bottom melet tissue and mechanized fiber tissue proliferation leads to a stenosis of the lumen, necrosis of mucosal epithelium and tube wall inflammation makes the fine branch trachea collapse, narrow, distorted, deformation or expansion, and then focal pneumonia, small abscess, Alveolar wall fibrosis and other lesions, these lesions also involve the surrounding lung tissue and pleura, causing fiber tissue hyperplasia and pleural adhesion.\",\n",

At present, anti-acoustic phospholipid antibodies have no immune protection, anti-microtoxic spiral antibody protection is also very limited, mainly due to syphilis In the course of the disease, the antibody can have a high titer in the second phase, but the syphilis spirals can still reproduce and spread, and the cellular immune effect is currently considered to play an extremely important immunity in syphilis. Studies have shown that Early syphilis patients treated in formal drums have obvious cellular immunosuppressive phenomena, such as T cells subgroup CD4 + and CD4 + / CD8 + T cell proportion below normal control group, while CD8 + is significantly higher than normal control group; Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) The ability to produce interleukin 22 (interleukin22, IL22) is getting lower and lower, and Salazar J.

Pathological layout: there are many pathological layouts, and there are four other types:\\n(1) akerlund classification: AKERLUND (1933) divides the esophageal cracked hernia into three types.\\nType I (congenital short-range tubular cracked pompon): congenital short-range tube, stomach is pulled into the chest; or the congenital esophageal fracture development defect is too large, and the stomach tubes are shorter and the secondary esophageal is shortened.\\nType II (esophageal bypass aperture): The cardia is located in the normal position, and some of the abdominal abdominal abdominal abdominal abdominal abdominal abdominal tartr is taken into the chest, the cleavage is increased, and the cause of the disease can be an abnormal developmental factor.\\nType III (esophageal stomach sliding] This type is the most common, the gastroesophageal binding part is in the diaphragm, the cardia is located after the back, the HIS corner is blunt angle, no real hernia, the tube ligament is elongated, relax, stomach The left artery is also tightened, and the stomach is partially or completely returned to the abdominal cavity when standing position.\\n(2) Shinner classification: According to anatomical defect and clinical manifestations, the esophageal cracked pores are divided into Type 4:\\nType I (esophageal split hemia): The esophageal cracked hole is mild, the tube ligament is thin, the cardia and the bottom of the gastric, there are different degrees of stomach, esophagus reflux.\\nType II (esophageal hemum): aphorne tube ligament defect, has a peritoneal formation of hernia, and normal cardia is normal, no stomach, esophagus reflux.\\nType III (mixed): esophageal splitting and esophagus is present at the same time, stomach and esophagus refractive flow.\\nIV type (multiple organ): part of the colon or small intestine also enters the esophagus.\\n(3) Allison classification: Type 5, type I: esophageal tubia; type II: Sliding of the esophagus: Type II: Sliding hernia; type IV: Esophageal sliding hernia; V-type: congenital short-range tube.\\n(4) BARRETT classification: Barrett The contents of the chest cavity were multi-widowed, pathological and clinical changes were brought into from the extent of esophageal cell development defects, and the esophageal cracked pores were divided into three types (Fig. 8).\\nType I: Esophages sliding hernia; type II: esophageal hemum; type III: mixed hernia.\\nDue to the simple and practical Barrett classification, it is commonly used at home and abroad.\\n2. Pathophysiology: Press BARRETT classification.\\n(1) Esophageal hole sliding sputum: hernia ring is the open esophageal split hole, and hernia content object is an esophageal abdominal cavity section, a cardia, and has no real hernia. When the amount of lying or abdominal pressure, the esophagus is abdominal, and the cardia And the bottom of the gastropracure can be brought into the; the abdominal pressure is reduced or the gastric air is empty, esophageal, cardia is slide back to normal position, and the abdominal cavity of most esophageal is shortened, the gastric His angle is blunt, due to the gastroesophageal joint And the gastropose enters post, under the negative pressure in the chest, the lower epithelial negative pressure is lost, and the gastroesophageal reflux will be pointed out that the gastrointestinal reflux is not all pathological, normal people also There is an occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux, especially after eating, simple gastrogenic reflux does not necessarily lead to the occurrence and symptoms of esophagitis, and the study found that the degree of acid gastric content on the esophagus is dependent on esophageal pair. The profile capability of acid gastric content, alkaline saliva on the neutralization of gastric acid, the ability of esophageal mucosa anti-acid erosion, esophagus, the esophagus, the extent of acid gastric content, the effect of esophageal peristalsis, gravity and position relationship, In particular, especially the esophageal peristaltic function is more important. Under normal circumstances, the anti-fluid can trigger an esophageal deductive peristalsis. Once the reflux is a reflux, an esophageal is produced a strong peristaltic wave to exclude an acidic content in the esophageal cavity to make the esophageal. The acidity in the internal acidity quickly returned to the original level, when the early esophageal fuma is small, the defects of local anatomy can induce a mild acid reflux, and the esophagus passes the compensation mechanism of itself, enhances the peristaltic function of the esophagus, and increases the esophagus. Acid removal ability, avoiding or alleviate esophageal mucosa damage, at this time, the gastroesophageal reflux is expressed as a non-blown mucosa morphology, when the reflux frequency or reverse flow exceeds a certain limit, or the creep of the esophageal itself is not enough to clear the refractive flow to esophageal When the acidic anti-fluid is destroyed, the compensation mechanism is destroyed, causing damage and inflammation of esophageal mucosa under gastric acid and gastric protease, and inflammation, it is limited to mucosa congestion and edema under esophagus, and antifurnurial in patients with esophageal sputum. After the gastritis, the esophageal power can occur, mainly manifested as the distal peristalsis of the esophageal, further decreases the profile ability of the acid anti-fluid, under the stimulation of the reflux for a long time in the stomach, and the esophageal mucosa inflammation is heavier, destroyed To form ulcerative esophagitis, the edema of the esophageal wall and the spasm of esophageal muscle layers narrow the esophageal cavity, and the inflammation can be tired and eaten into the esophageal muscles and even tissue surrounding tissue, and there is an esophagitis and esophageal surrogitis. Long-term repeated episodes, collagen coverage and granulation tissue hyperplasia during ulcer, resulting in thickening, stiff, and ultimately leading to esophageal fibrosis, scar esophageal stenosis and / or short shrinkage, and obstruction, Skinnex report, The incidence of esophageal stenosis in patients with antibody cracked cracked hernia was 20%, and the child was 35%, especially the 60-80-year-old patient.\\nUnderwater sphincter can have a short relaxation, and the frequency of sphincter in the evening sphincter has increased during the day and day, and the amount of gastric acid has high stomachic secretion (high degree of vagus neuro), the esophageal peristalsis is reduced, the saliva is not enough to neutral acid, and the antiflow mainly has gastric acid. And stomach protease composition (no food in the stomach), so the food tube cleavage sliding hernia has more opportunities, and the anti-fluid is sucking the throat and trachea, and the inflammatory polyps of vocal cord can also cause it due to misunderstandings. Repeated pneumonia, bronchitis, inhabitial foreign objects inhalation can cause pulmonary abscess or bronchial expansion, and can also induce asthma attack, especially newborns, infants and young children, some infant patients often sleep often due to sleep In the middle of the gastroesophageal reflux, the anti-fluid is mistakenly sucking the trachea, the bronchi, often caught cough, crying, and even cause neonatal suffocation death, clinically, in response to respiratory infection, the doctor is also common.\\nIn the past, the diaphragmatic feet constituting the esophageal pores, the tube ligament slack, the gastrointestinal HIS angle, and the abnormal esophageal function of the esophagus, etc., the cause of gastroenterological reflux, and through surgery with a blunt HIS angle change Rui, repairing the expanded esophageal fracture hole has achieved a certain effect, and it also confirmed the relationship between the above factors and gastro, but at present, the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux is not related to the size and anatomic abnormality of crack hole, while the food guancycopy muscle The formation of physiological high pressure regions play an important role in anti-reverse flow barriers, and the food hostrum sphincter is mainly related to the length of the lower food horn, and the scholars are considered:\\n1 Under the food hinges sphincter pressure <7 mmHg.\\n2 When the food guanphrochemical function is <2 cm, or the esophageal abdominal cavity segment <1.0cm, it indicated that the food gangent sphincter is not complex, it has been confirmed that the cause of gastroesophageal reflux in patients with esophageal cracked hernia is that the length of the meal sphincter and the food guanphochetic stress Abnormal, but some scholars believe that the food hostrum sphincter pressure of esophageal sputum has no obvious abnormalities, and the shortage of food hostrum sphinus is the main factor that causes the dysfunction of the messenger function. Zhou Xuelian, China, is also found in clinical studies. Upperflow hinges are not important in the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux in patients with esophageal cracked hernia; an esophageal abdomen segment is the place where the food hostrum bursary function is formed, and its length constitutes an integral part of the full function of the hindenges, and recovered by surgery. The length of the esophageal abdomen interior anti-reverse flow, its efficacy is closely related to the length of the intraoperative intake tube section, and the mild effect is good, indicating that the length of the inner segment of the esophageal is a key reason for the reflux.\\n(2) Esopharmaceuticals: Each of the Early Esteasters of Embryo, such as failing to disappear in the development process, as well as diaphragmatic development, causing esophageal split hole, the gastropia can be thus the defect or weak part On the back, the esophagus is formed to form an esophagus, at this time, the cardia is still in the sputum, the gastric HIS is constant, the esophageal abdominal cavity maintains a certain length, and the food gauge has no abnormalities and maintains a good anti-reflow mechanism. Typeless gastrointestinal refractive flow phenomenon, stomach large bend and partial stomach or full stomach can also be disheated into the chest, constitute a huge esophagus, such as the full stomach and pyloric long-axis direction to turn into the chest, which can cause the stomach torsion , Obstruction\\n(3) Mixed hernia: The esophageal ligament is obviously slack, can\\'t fix the esophageal, cardia, causing it to slide on the esophageal split hole, and there is a stomach hind into the chest, both gastric His angles, and the fat factor of the messenger.

Pathological histological studies have shown that the yellow ligamental osteogenization is mainly in cartilage, in the early stage, the fibrous structure is disordered, the collagen fiber is significantly hyperplained, the elastic fiber is extremely reduced, in swelling collagen fibers, there are many fiber soft bone cells And a large number of island-shaped bone stoves, there is a bone girders, bone marrow cavity and Harvard tube in the bone stove.

Return:\\nWith the growth of age, the degeneration is an inevitable process. When the small joint is laborious or trauma, the joint vesicle is thick, the scar formation, the joint sac is damaged, so that the latencytic secretion is lost, and the suction liquid secretion is reduced.

Many micro-anti-aramids are formed on the intracerea in the brain in the brain in patients with hypertension, and the diameter of the brain, brain, and cerebral diameters in the cerebral bridge, brain, and cerebral brain in the brain. This aneurysm is a capsule in the weak portion of the vascular wall. When the blood pressure suddenly increases, this cystic blood vessel is easily ruined to cause cerebral hemorrhage.\\n(2) Fat glass sample or fiber necrosis: long-term high blood pressure on the brain, 100 ~ 300 μm, small air-wear arterial tube wall, the endometrium, the lipids within the plasma enters the inner membrane, so that Wall thickening and plasma cell infiltration, forming fat glass samples, and finally leads to die of tube wall.

Cerebral infarction occurs in patients with cerebral analgesia, and the arteries in the bulk cerebral lack of softening zone are susceptible to bleeding, forming bleeding necrosis lesions.\\n(4) The outer membranes and middle layers of the cerebral artery are weak: the cerebral artery and the deep puncturing - soybean artery taken, this anatomical structure is suddenly elevated by factors such as force, excitement, etc. This blood vessel is easy to rupture bleeding.',\n",

       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nThe skull defects are visible:\\n1. Open craniocerebral injury, especially firewriter injury\\n2. Closed craniocerebral injury remove hematoma, but the intracranial pressure is still high after the inactive brain tissue, and the intracranial pressure is removed.\\n3. Skull disease such as osteoma is changed.\\nThe subordinate bone, the regenerative ability is poor, the neoehere is mainly from the inner ribs, and the bone regeneration capacity is lost after 5 ~ 6 years, and the diameter is less than 1 cm can heal, and the diameter is 2 ~ 3cm, which is difficult to repair, thus Legacy skull defect.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nUsually, the skull defect is less than 3 cm. There is more symptoms; after application of temporal decompression or pillow reduction surgery, hypertrophic muscle and fascia cover and can form a tough fibrous healing layer in the defective area, which is originally The protective effect of skull on the brain, there is no symptom in clinical practice, causing severe malformation of patients, directly affecting intracranial embossed rational balance, collapse in standing upright, sleeper, lacquered in the morning, convex in the evening Or because the atmospheric pressure is directly connected to the brain tissue, it will make a long time, it will cause local brain atrophy and increase the symptoms of brain waste. At the same time, the patient has gradually expanded or deformed to the defect zone. In addition, the pediatric skull defect can be With the development of brain tissue, the edge of the defect is turned over, and the convex brain tissue is gradually atrophy and capsule, so children need complete skull to ensure the normal development of the brain.',\n",
       " \"The bottom fracture is mostly the joint fracture of the cranial cover and the skull, most of which are linear fractures. Causes occurring:\\nAccording to the fracture shape: linear fracture, depression fracture, pulverized fracture, children's growth fracture. The fracture sheet of the depressed or pulverized fractures can be damaged by both the meningum and the brain damage to the cerebral vascular and cranial nerve. The cranial fracture is approximately 15-20% of craniocerebral injury, which can occur in any part of the skull, the top bone, the amount of bone, the temporal and the pillow. Generally, the fracture line does not cross the skull, such as excessive violence, can also affect the orthosary. The positive side of the head can be diagnosed. Due to the difference in fracture, the treatment and prognosis are also different.\\nViolence causes the skull to universally bending the deformation. Light people generally have obvious sense of compression, and the eyes are a bit outstanding, and there is no reaction such as vomiting. But serious can cause skull base fractures.\\nIt is generally uncomfortable.\\nThe vertical direction impact head or falls from the height, but hips. According to its anatomical part: the fracture of the intracranial nest; the fracture of the intracranial nest; the fracture of the skull. The skull base fracture is generally closed damage, and the fracture itself does not require special treatment, mainly for the intracranial, sore cedar and injury and prevent infection. General prognosis is preferred.\",\n",
       " 'In addition to the cerebrospinal fluid fistula after trauma, common diseases are too much after the lumbar puncture, the waist is inspected, or the hydraulic fluid continues to exudate from the puncture portion from the puncture portion, so that the pressure in the vertebral tube is lowered.After the pain-sensitive tissue of the hindranium is pulled downward, leading to headache.',\n",

       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nIn male Central Plains, the most common, women are generally considered to be maximum of breast cancer, except for breast cancer and breasts (women), and parts of the organic tract, urinary tract, uterus, and Ovary, skin, prostate, thyroid, bone, etc.\\nIn recent years, the molecular biological mechanism of tumor metastasis has been studied very active, and tumor metastasis is composed of a series of complex biological events, which is generally under the process: 1 gene activation, amplification, deletion or inhibitory gene inactivation; 2 new blood vessel formation; 3 malignant proliferation of cells; 4 escape of host immunity; 5 tolerate drug treatment; 6 tumor expression and activation transfer related genes in violation; 7 tumor cells through adhesion molecules, protease activity changes and cell movement to transfer in transfer site secretion, blood vessels Generation factors, cloning growth, has found that the invasion and metastasis capacity of tumor cells is mainly related to abnormal cell \"social\" function, and the \"home\" function of cells is not obvious, and the cell \"social\" function is mainly Cell surface involved in the glycosylation abnormality of various glycoprotein molecules thereof, this abnormality includes many types, wherein the formation of the formation of the N-connection sugar chain β1, 6 branch antennas is most common, and a large number of studies have confirmed. The invasion behavior of tumor cells is largely formed by excess of β1, 6 branches on the surface of the cells, thereby producing a multi-antenna N-sugar chain structure, thereby changing the biological shape of glycoprotein molecules, so that tumor cell adhesion is abnormal. Increase the transfer potential of tumor cells.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nBlood-based spreads and direct infiltration are two main intracranial transfer pathways, lymph metastasis and cerebrospinal fluid metastasis.\\n1. Direct infiltration: skull peripheral and approaching organ, tissue, eye, ear, nasopharyngeal, nasal sinus, head, neck soft tissue, etc. are the top and secondary tumors, common nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Netoma, neck venous spherical tumors, they can directly infiltrate the skull, a honeglass, or the essence of the outer surface of the skull base, the neurology and blood vessels in the skull base pore, structure loose, easy to tumor cell invasion Some pores are not only their bone films, but also communicate with the spider web, such as eyes and eyelids, tumor cells invaded into the intracranial, or widely spread with the cerebral fluid, or in the brain The gap surrounding the large blood vessel invades the brain.\\n2. Blood transfer: Most tumor cell metastasis is through the blood pathway, which is through the arterial system, and a few tumors can be transferred to intracranial transfer through the vertebral vein system. After the primary tumor grows to a certain volume, the new blood vessels are long. Tumor cells infiltrate small blood vessels, mostly veins, refluxed to the heart with blood, and then passed through the carotid artery and vertebral artery system to intracranial spread, common blood transfer primary tumors are lung cancer (12.66%), breast cancer (16.96) %), Chronophotocarcinoma (8%), melanoma (7.68%), digestive tract cancer (7.66%), kidney cancer (7.66%), other (12%) and unidentified persons (12.06%), due to my country\\'s breast The incidence of cancer and prostate cancer is relatively low in Western countries, and the incidence of epithelial cancer is higher than that of Western countries, so in intracranial metastases in my country, the epithelial cancer is second only to lung cancer, ranking 2nd, meat corner metastasis Only 7%, which is related to the ratio of sarcoma and cancer. In the lymphmonia tumor, the intracranial metastasis is similar to the pulmonary cancer.\\n3. Cerebrospinal fluid transfer and lymph transfer: some brain and spinal cord tumors, especially chamber, and differentiated gliomas, which can be planted along the subarachnoid discharge, often occur after tumor resection or biopsy , The malignant tumor of the skull peripheral and approximate site can be used to enter the cerebrospinal fluid or the vertebral venous plexus by the lymphatic gap around the cranial cavity, and the intracranial transfer occurs.\\n4. Part of the tumor\\n(1) Brain substance: Most of the tumor occurred in the brain in the cerebral arterial blood supply area, which is due to the thickness of the intervertebral artery, and the motor veins of the brain is the natural continuation of the internal carotid artery, the pipe diameter is thick, blood supply Therefore, the most common transfer site is the average leaf, and the temporal pillow is in turn, but also more than 2 brain leaves, even simultaneously tired of both the brain hemisphere, these metastatic tumors are common in the junction of cortical and white matter. This is because blood supply of cerebral cortex is 3 to 4 times the white matter under the cortex, and thus the blood supply artery in anatomical structure is suddenly thinned at the junction of the leather - white matter, most of the metastatic cancer is involved in this and easy to transfer here. , Growing, clinically, from the lungs, uterus, etc.\\n(2) Soft mesh and spider mesh: Common acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, breast cancer, etc. transfer, basal pool, side crack pool is most often involved in the thickening of the spider, and the ash is opaque, a bit The bleeding and tumor sulphic dispersion was discharged, and there was also a tumor cell deposition on the end of the cerebral elevation.\\n(3) Hard melt: Commonly metastases in prostate cancer, breast cancer, malignant lymphoma, melanoma, etc. Transfer accumulated and large vein sinus or brain nerves can cause significant clinical symptoms, which are common types of children\\'s metastases.\\n5. The pathological type of primary tumors understands the different pathological types of primary tumors are important for guiding radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Among them, adenocarcinoma is the most common pathological pathological type, which is the first place in pulmonary cancer accounting for intracranial metastasis. The most metastasis of adenocarcinoma; of course, the type of adenocarcinoma in the digestive tract can also be transferred to intracranial, other common types are squamous cell carcinoma, unlessedified cancer, papillary cancer, sarcoma, etc.\\n6. Most of the pathological characteristics of metastatoids and type brain metastatoma are multiple, with multi-stricken, Harr and other autopsy reports account for 75%, but it is not the case in clinical practice, which is not available because of existing inspection Check out a small lesion, because of its small and no clinical manifestations, some patients do not visit, according to their pathological features, can be divided into the following two categories:\\n(1) Type: This is the most common type, the difference is very different, the large diameter can reach more than 10cm, the small person often does not see, and can be divided into single and multi-haired, more people often due to tumor Cells are simultaneously in the brain, and the tumors are often spherical, and the border is clear, the initial growth is growing at the junction of the white matter, and gradually grows up, and the internal direction is growing, and the hard film is grown. The speed is often faster, if it is bleeding or cystic changing, the clinical symptoms are obvious, the tumor quality is soft and hard, the blood is not rich, can be purple, can also be gray yellow or gray red, less tumor It is often entity, if it grows up, and the growth is often a central partial cystic change or even bleeding, the cyst contains yellow, red-red or brown liquid, individual presuppulent, and the peripheral edema of the tumor makes the boundary relatively clear, its edema It can be related to the tumor type, tumor blood vessel, the amount of permeability, local metabolism and tumor cell secretion, can also be related to the metastasis of the tumor, the specificity of arterial blood supply, and the particularities of the brain intravenous anatomy, but There is no significant relationship between edema and tumor. The boundary between tumor tissues under microscope is unclear. The tumor cell nest is often infiltrated around the vascular outer membrane and brain tissue, surrounding edema, softening and glue hyperplasia, its organizational characteristics and original The characteristics of the tumor can be consistent, and the obvious person can be inferred to the original tumor to guide the clinical search for primary stoves, but the low degree of differentiation does not clarify the original lesion, often with clinically glioma The characteristics are mixed. If the adenoma sample or the papillary structure may be misdiagnosed as a chamber tumor, the metastatic tumor has its own intrinsic characteristics such as cancer cells often differ in normal nerve cells, inflammatory stoves or coagulation necrosis backgrounds. The boundary is clear, the nuclear increase is all-shaped, the nuclear pulley ratio increases, the nuclear film is obvious, the nucleols become large, the dyeing is a mesh, and there can be aerobubles in the cytoplasm.\\n(2) A diffuse: less, can exist or in the same manner as the nodule type, often caused by systemic systemic diseases, exhibiting a wide variety of meninges, accumulating soft mesh, submersible messenger, so that it is widely thicker , Opaque, sometimes a little bleeding and tumor dispersion cloth, which can be seen under microscope, tumor cell infiltration.',\n",

       " 'The common cause is the fracture of the intracranial bone and the fracture of the mastoid, and the portion of about 50% of the longitudinal fractures and 25% horizontal fractures are accompanied by tentivial cranial nerve damage, especially the longitudinally parallel to the long axis of the rock cone.The fracture of the row, the top nerve is most observed, bruised or fracture sheets, and the early morning hair style or delayed face nerve paralysis.',\n",
       " '(1) Causes of the disease\\nThe injuries of chronic epidural hematoma and the acute people are not particularly, and their different persons can have long-term hematoma for a long time after the patient is injured, and the expression of clinical symptoms is very slow, which may be with the size of the hematoma, formation The speed, location and the compensation capabilities of the patient\\'s cranial volume are related, so there is blood from the vein, in addition, some people think that it is caused by cracking in the meningum in the mening membrane caused by trauma.\\nClinically, a few delayed brain-hematoma: None of the first CT scan, there is no obvious image abnormality, but when the CT scan is scanned after a few hours or even more than ten days, he found that hematoma, this is the time or course of hematoma. The eager, accounting for 5% to 22% of the whole hard meltraza hematoma, with many young people, the cause may be the source of hemorrhage during head trauma, but due to injury, other brain tissue edema, other formation Hematoma and certain factors that cause increasing intracranial pressure, forming a fill effect and has a compression effect on the blood source, but later uses excessive ventilation, strong dehydration, control cerebrospinal leakage, clearing intracranial hematoma and surgical pressure reduction, or Due to the influence of systemic hypotension, the intracranial high pressure is rapidly decreased, and suddenly lost the fill effect, so that the brain membrane is peeled off, and there is a delayed brain membrane hematoma.\\n(2) pathogenesis\\nThe mechanism of chronic epidural hematoma is still unclear. Most people use bleeding speed to explain the hematoma formation process. Gallagher (1968) proposes the \"venous bleeding\" point of view. He believes that the anatomical position of intravenous veins in my own mesh is more susceptible to damage than in the meantic membrane. Burres (1979) also found that the arteries in chronic epidural hematoma patients were intact, so he agreed that IWakuma (1973) believed in pediatric cases, bleeding of bleeding in the cap The epidural outer cavity is also one of the mechanisms that form chronic epidural hematoma. The view of \"venous bleeding\", CLAVEL (1982) believes that the part of the hematoma is the most important factor in chronic epidural hematoma, which occurs in an uncomtened part of epidural hematoma, which is relatively close to the combination of the hard film and the skull in these parts. A hematoma quickly formed in a short time, he believes that the occurrence of \"bleeding source\" is uncommon, because there is no clear bleeding source in considerable part of chronic epidural hematoma patients, McLaurin and Duffner (1993) believes that hematoma, hematoma, the compensation of the cranial cavity volume, the cranial fracture and individual tolerance difference is the main factor in the formation of chronic epidural hematoma, and the source of bleeding is secondary, because 52% ~ 67% of chronic epidural hematoma is located in the top of the top, and the bleeding source of this part is mostly venous sinus, the bleeding venous bleeding, and the intracranial pressure caused by the slow bleeding process can compensate for the discharge of cerebrospinal fluid. Netherly adhesive, it is not easy to quickly form hematoma, and epidural extraction can reduce or absorb or absorb or absorb under skull bone seams under the bone episodes or capson membranes. The cause of the epidural hematoma can explain that some cases can not find the source of bleeding, in addition, some people have proposed one of the aneurysm rupture in the traumatic pseudogeneous mesh, and one of the causes of chronic epidural hematoma. Some people review 14 resilience Hematic hematoma occurring in aneurysm rupture bleeding, and it manifests as an acute or chronic process.\\nThe chronic hard meltrass hematoma is usually presented in the early stage, and a layer of granulation tissue is formed on the local hardement, these granulation tissue can be displayed on CT, only a few chronic hematoma form an envelope and center liquefaction, but For a long time, it is generally about 5 weeks.',\n",

       " \"Including embryonic brain development deformity, congenital cerebral water, mother pregnancy, severe infection (especially viral infection), severe nutrient lack, trauma, poisoning (such as gestational toxia) and radiation irradiation, genetic factors in onset The role is not obvious.\\nCase analysis showed that premature birth is a determination of brain paralysis. The United States has more than 50,000 balances per year. In premature babies, in 85% survive, 5% ~ 15% suffer from brain paralysis, 25% ~ 30% There is a school-age mental disorder (Volpe, 1989), the childbirth time is too long, the umbilical cord around the neck, the placenta, the front placenta, amniotic fluid blockage and fetal inhalation, etc. Outlier injury and intracranial hemorrhage are common for perinatal causes, newborns hyperbidinum hypermia caused by unsuccess or other causes of mother and child, such as serum unbound bilirubin> 340μmol / L may develop as a biliary brain disease Causes brain.\\nIncluding various infections, trauma, poisoning, intracranial hemorrhage and critical paratrosity, Russman's high risk factors including brain, have epilepsy, hyperthyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and toxal hypermatherapy, 3 months of pregnancy, bleeding incidents, birth The uterine contraction is weak, the placenta is early stripping, the front placenta and buttocks are also induced.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe maintenance of the normal muscle tension adjustment and posture reflection depends on the dynamic balance of cortical downlink fiber inhibition and the surrounding type Ia type, such as leather downlink fiber bundle damage, downward inhibitory effect inexpensively, surrounding fiber The excitement is relatively enhanced, and there is an abnormality of sputum movement, and the perceived ability is as good. Listening ability can make the child mentally low, the base festival is damaged can lead to the hand and foot Xu dynasty, the cerebellum can occur Wait.\\nThere are two categories of special pathological changes in brain.\\n1 hemorrhagic damage, visible ventricular pipe film, bleeding or intracerecy, more common in less than 32 weeks of pregnancy, may be relatively large, the cerebral blood flow is relatively large, blood vessels are fragile, vascular nerve development is not perfect, regulate blood blood The capacity of traffic is poor.\\n2 ischemic damage, such as cerebral white matter softening, cortical atrophy or atrophic cerebral leaf hardening, more than hypoxia and suffocation.\\nIn recent years, many diseases are used in foreign countries, mainly divided into three types:\\n1, premature infant matrix (ventricular membrane) bleeding, is the bleeding of bleeding near the tail nucleus of the cerebral hybrid Monro holes, which is in place in the vascular membrane cell gamma, often tier and bilateral and asymmetrical.\\nThe blood supply zone under the ventricular pipeline was returned to the artery, choroid artery and Heubner return arterial blood supply, venous blood passed through deep veins into Galen veins, about 25% of the matrix hemorrhage is divided into small cavity, and the rest is broken into the side end room. Or adjacent to brain tissue, a set of 914 newborns have been shown, 284 cases of bleeding, accounting for 31% of the total, all of which are low and heavy, and the etiology and mechanism of blood bleeding under ventricular membranes are unclear. It may be significantly increased with the venous pressure of the matrix layer, lack of sufficient support organization, blood pressure or venous pressure increase may be related to the pulmonary lesions of premature infants.\\n2, the white matter side of the ventricle is the white matter band necrosis that occurs in the cortical branch and the deep-wearing action, located on the side of the side, the side of the side, and can involve a pillow-like radiation and radiopathic sensory moving fiber, Swedish investigation According to the report, 55% of the sputilage bilateral premature infants are bleeding under the vessel membrane, the white matter softened or both, and the children often have brain bilateral paralysis and intellectual disorders, and the intensive disorder is often greater than cognition and speech. Dunctional obstacles, seeing a case of 1/3 of the virum membrane, it can also occur in premature infants or feet infants in low blood pressure and breathing, and CHAPLIN, 20 patients with hydrandon, 40% obvious exercise disorder, 40% obvious exercise disorder, More than 60% of the children, the IQ is less than 85 points, and Victor et al. Observed 12 cases of light cases. The average weight of the child was 1.8kg, and the average pregnant age was 32.3 weeks. Only 1 case of scorposis bilateral paralysis, 9 case IQ In the range of low and normal or within the normal IQ, the average survival is 8.5 years old.\\n3, hypoxic-ischemic eNcenopathy is a clinical syndrome of neonatal hypoxia, ischemia, causing brain damage, although many newborns have different degrees Ascending, but only a few brain damage, many cerebral palsy can also have a duration in peace, indicating that some prenatal, postpartum pathogenic factors also play an important role, animal experiments confirm that the baby is just born after birth CNS Tolerate hypoxia, the ischemic ability is the strongest in their lives. When the arterial oxygen is divided into 10% to 15% of normal value, the brain damage is low, and the function of other organs will exacerbate the degree of brain injury. Such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia cause low blood pressure, reasonable explanation is that hypoxia-ischemic encephalopathy is usually in the uterus, while in the birth of a clinical symptom.\\nPre-risk factors of hypoxia-ischemic encephalopathy may include gestational toxia, pregnancy uterine bleeding or development abnormalities such as miniature infants, the cause is mainly the abnormal production of abnormal production and prenatal pathogenic factors such as uterine hypoxia, ischemia. Waiting, and the mother's mental abnormality, the birth weight is less than 2,000g, fatal malformation and buttocks, etc. 21% have some degree of suffocation, other factors related to the disease include epilepsy, compatriots have sports dysfunction, 2 or more compaints early, mother suffering from thyroidism, predale or epilepsy, etc. The pathogenic factors of children with fertile brain are different, nearly half of the cases of pregnancy, low malnutrition, low-quality, placental infarction and intratooming, severe newborns suffocation is full month Or premature infants have an important cause of the SPASTIC-MYODYSTINIC-ATAXIC SYNDROME.\\nWhen there is no hypoxia-ischemia, ischemia, matrix bleeding and white matter softening, other reasons should be considered, and the symmetrical brain wear aberration brain defect is often located on one side of the leaves, which can lead to congenital hemiplegia, such as the disease is located in double On the side, there is a highlightened and severe mental dysfunction; most hemispheres on both sides of the cerebral water have been replaced by a film, only the lower part of the temporal impel, the pillin, pillow and the base core, the skull can be complete or increased The child can survive for several weeks, months or years, can save the basic functions of the brain stem.\",\n",
