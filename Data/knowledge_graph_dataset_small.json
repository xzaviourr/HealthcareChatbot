    "cause": "(1) Causes of the disease\nPathogenic bacteria is Bordtella, B. Perdush, often known as the 100-day Ethioplast, known to Bobacea has four bacilli, except for Bobs, there is a hundred days of Bobs bacteria (B. Parapertussis), B. Bronchiseptica and B. Avium, bird type Bobia generally does not cause human disease, only causes bird infection, and hundredth and cough About 1.0 ~ 1.5 \u03bcm, width of about 0.3 ~ 0.5 \u03bcm, capsule, can not exercise, Gram-dyed negative, oxygen, no spores, no flagepan, with a deep colors with benzene blue stained, bacterial culture requires a lot ( 15% ~ 25%) can breed good, so often with Border-gengous medium (i.e., blood, glycerol, potato), and a slow growth of 100-day Ethiococci growth, 35 ~ 37 \u00b0 C in a humid environment 3 ~ After 7 days, a small, opaque colonies grow, the initial colonus, smooth, smooth (S) type, also known as the I phase bacteria, high morphology, capsular and strong virulence and antigenicity, Strong disease, such as continuing culture of the separation colonies in ordinary medium, the colony becomes a rough (R) type, called IV phase bacteria, no capsule, virulence and antigenic loss, and lose pathogenic force, II-phase, III phase is intermediate transition type, and hundred-day Ethiochagus can produce many toxic factors, and five toxins are known:\n1. Hundreds of cough toxin (PT): A protein in the Wall of the Bacillus cell wall, in the past, called leukocytosis or lymphocyte promoter, LPE, histamine sensing factor, HSF ), Insulin secretion Protein (IAP), and hundred-day coughing toxin consists of five non-current co-chain subunits (S1 ~ S5), subunits (S2 ~ S5) are non-toxic units, energy to host cell membrane In combination, by medoxifying the toxicity by the sub-unit S1 having enzyme activity, S1 can vary by adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-riboside transferase, catalytic partial ADP-ribothermia from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) Separate, transfer to the cell membrane inhibit the binding of glycine triphosphate (CTP), which can cause cell changes, while also promoting lymphocytes increase, activates tyrants and enhances immune responses.\n2, heat-resistant endotoxin (ET), 100 \u00b0 C 60min can only partially destroy, 180 \u00b0 C can be inactivated, this toxin can cause the body to heat and cock.\n3, non-heat-resistant toxin (HLT) This toxin heating 55 \u00b0 C can damage its toxicity, this toxin antibody has no protective effect on 100-day Ethiocardium infection.\n4, tracheal cytotoxin (TCT): can damage host respiratory fiberioplasmic cells, calendering, necrosis.\n5, adenosyl cycloacteria toxin (ACT): An enzyme in the surface of the cytoplastine cells, this enzyme is activated by calcium concentration, catalyzes CAMP, and inhibits neutrophils. Chemotization and phagocytic cells to sterilize it, allowing it to sustain infection, ACT is also a hemolynee, can have a hemolytic effect, and the important antigen of a temperate cough is two blood coagulant antigen, a filamentous blood. (FiLamentous Hemagglutininininin, FHA), is determined in the process of a cyclopellasia in the process of cyclopellasia in the process of a cytoplasty, which is a pathogenic. Experiments have found that FHA immunization mice can fight against 100-day Etougiobacillus lethal attacks, so FHA is a protective antigen, another aggluginoS, AGG is a protein component in the 100-day metoplastoma and bacteria hair, mainly 1 2, 3 serotypes, AGG-1 has specifically; the AGG-2, 3 has type specificity, by detecting the type of agglomerates to understand the local popularity, currently considers these two hemagglutints Antigen corresponding antibody is a protective antibody, and the 100-day Ethiocardium is divided into seven-type aggregation according to the non-heat-resistant aggregate antigen, and the 1 type aggregation is originally equipped with all the hundred-day Cysisfacials, and the 7-type agglomeration is originally Bobia (including the second hundred days cough Bacillus, bronchial seporatomy, 2 to 6 types are divided into different serotypes at different cooperation, and the serotype is mainly studying the serotype of the epidemic strain and selects special serotype strains. , Sub-rigorous colostrum and hundred-day Ethiocardium have no cross immunization, can also cause epidemics, 100-day Ethioplastoni resistance to external physical and chemical factors, 55 \u00b0 C is damaged, and it can be killed in the drying agent, and the ultraviolet line The resistance is weak, but there is a longer living in 0 ~ 10 \u00b0 C.\n(2) pathogenesis\n1. The pathogenesis: the pathogenesis of the trees is not very clear, it is very likely to be a result of the comprehensive role of the hydrazine of the body. When the bacteria immersed in the breath of the susceptible person, the bacteria filamentous hemagglin is adhered to the throat. Bronchial mucosa fibropolitic epithelial cell surface; follow, bacteria in partial reproduction and produce a variety of toxins such as peroperative toxins, adenosine cycloacteria, etc. And the whole body reaction, due to the lesion of the epithelial cells and the sputum and necrotic epithelial piles in small bronchi, the secretions are discharged, and the peripheral nerve of the respiratory tract is incorporated into the cerebral cortex and the medullary cough center, reflectivity Spasmity cough, due to long-term stimulation, the cough center has been excited, so that non-specific stimulation, such as eating, pharyngeal examination, cold wind, smoke, injection pain, etc., can cause reflective cocking, and the recovery period can also cry and cry and Other infections, induced cytopathic cough, recent studies have shown that there is a cytoplasma-based immune function that is damaged by the Host cellular immune function of the 100-day vitamin toxin substance, CD4 + T cells and Th1 cells secreted with cytokines, in a 100-day Ethiocardium infection It plays an important role in it.\n2, the disease is understood: 100th Cithia invades nasopharynx, laryngeal, bronchial mucosa, visible mucosa congestion, the base of epithelial cells has multi-core white cells, monocytes infiltration and partial cell necrosis. In addition to inflammation infiltration in bronchial and alveolar, it can be seen that epithelial cytoplasmic aerosol formation, and even nuclear membrane is broken, necrosis, fall off, but very little wavefront. If the branch obstruction can cause a lung, the bronchial expansion, the secondary infection, is prone to bronchial pneumonia, sometimes there is interstitial pneumonia; if there is a hundred-day cough, mirror inspection or naked eye can be seen in brain tissue congestion edema, point-shaped bleeding , Cortical atrophy, neurocyte denaturation, cerebral edema, etc., which can often be seen in the liver fat infiltration.",

It is estimated that there are about 10% of people around the world to be affected, and some local infections can be as high as 50%. In my country's distribution of rural areas, in recent years, due to my country's health status and living standards, acute amba Dysentery and abscess cases, in addition to individual areas, mostly, mostly a dispensing chronic delay or typical cases and insects.\n(1) Source:\nChronic patients, recovery patients and healthy pokers are the source of infection, the encapsulation resistance, in the humid low temperature environment, can survive more than 12 days, can live for 9 to 30 days in the water, but Encyclopedia is weak to dry, high temperature and chemical drugs, such as 50 \u00b0 C, short-term death, the survival time in the drying environment, in 0.2% hydrochloric acid, 10% ~ 20% saline and soy sauce, There is no longer survive in condiments such as vinegar, 50% of alcohol can quickly kill.\n(Ii) Saving the way:\nThere are several ways to spread in the dissolved tissue in the dissolved tissue:\n1 Envelope pollution water supply can cause the outbreak of outbreak in the region.\n2 is an important communication factor in fertilizer, unpaid and unconfined vegetables.\n3 Packed with finger, food or utensils.\n4 Dalks and cockroaches can be contacted with feces, and they will be contaminated with food, which will become an important media.\n\u3222 Popular characteristics:\nAmiba is widely released in the tissue, in the temperate area, the disease can be popular, and in the tropical and subtropical regions, the epidemic situation is particularly serious. Since the liberation of my country, the infection rate of Amiba will decrease significantly. For example, Beijing Capital Hospital has taken 38,075 cases in 1973 to 1978. The positive rate is 0.52%; Fujian Medical University has been sentenced to 216 children in 1976. The positive rate is 4.63%; Northeast Jiamu Medical College Report (1980), check the city's middle school students 487 cases, the positive rate is only 0.4%; in 1979, a total of 557 peasants in Zhejiang Yueqing, the positive rate was 3.2%, and the incidence of the incidence varies from time to time, in the autumn, summer, the incidence of more than men Female, adult more than children, which may be related to educating food or age immunity.",

    "cause": "Respiratory infection is especially the most common cause of this disease. Recent studies have found that patients with sexual immunodeficiency patients infected with PneumoCystis Carinii Pneumonia, the body is prone to anti-GBM antibody, Calderon and other reports. Three anti-IV collagen \u03b13 chain antibodies (anti-GBM antibody) positive in HIV infection, suggesting that alveolar damage in pulmonary hematocysts can induce pulmonary hemorrhage-nephritis syndrome.\nHard leather disease is a native tissue characteristic of connective tissue, hardening and atropical organizable tissue fibrosis, hardening and atrophy, which is mainly characterized by skin, synovial, skeletal muscle, blood vessels and esophagization. SCLERODERMA, is a native tissue characterized by limiting or diffuse skin and internal organs, which is characterized by connective tissue of fibrosis, hardening and atrophy. It is characterized by fibrosis of skin, synovial membrane, skeletal muscle, blood vessels and esophagus. Or hardened.\nInhalation Cocaine Perez, 1 case of long-term smoking patients occurred after 3 weeks of suction cocaine, a pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome occurred. Contact gasoline vapor hydroxyides, Turboot oils and inhale various hydrocarbons.\nPathogenesis\nSince some cases cause the body to generate an anti-pulley, the glomerular base film antibody is generated, and thereby attacks glomerulos and lungs, a type II metamorphosis reaction occurs, as for the simultaneous immune complex to the alveolar and glomerulane. There is no exact explanation of the pathogenesis of complement (III-type metamorphosis).\n1962 Steblay et al. Confirmed that the lung bleeding-nephritis syndrome of the glomerular base membrane (GBM) damage was mediated by anti-GBM antibody, and a large number of research work after subsection focused on separation and studying the GBM component, looking for antibodies The corresponding antigen and the molecular structure and characteristics of the antigen, in recent years, with the rapid development of molecular biology and biochemistry, in the \u03b13 (IV) chain of newly discovered collagen IV, NC1 domains of the \u03b13 (IV) chain It is a GoodPasture autogen, also known as the GoodPasture antigen, which cloned the antigen gene CO14A3, positioned in the second chromosome Q35 to 37 region.\nIt is confirmed that indirect immunofluorescence and immuno electron microscopy techniques are confirmed that GoodPasture antigen is not only seen in GBM, but also distributed in a renal tubular film (TBM), alveolar capillary film (ABM) and other tissue base films (such as choroid, corneal, crystal, retinal vessel) Base film, etc.), but the goodPasture antigen having a pathogenic action is mainly distributed in the reversibility of GBM, TBM, and ABM, antigen, which can expose the reversibility of its exposure process. In vitro, the \u03b13nc1 structure can be exposed by 6 mol hydrochloride or pH 3. Domain, but in vivo antigen is exposed and produced immune response injury GBM has not been fully understood. It is now speculated that the GoodPasture antigen hide in the collagen IV\u03b13nc1 domain under physiological conditions, various induced factors (toxins, viral infections, bacterial infections, tumors, Immunoma-genetic factors) and endotoxs can activate epithelium, endothelium and membrane cell proliferation, and release inflammatory media (IL-1, RDS, prostaglandin, neutral protease, etc.), GBM, etc. under cell enzyme, collagen IV Advanced Structure Decoction, Exposure of the GoodPasture antigen determinant, stimulating the body to produce antibody, resulting in immunization damage, due to the endothelial layer of the glomerular capillaries in the whole body capillary capillary, so that the antibody can be directly directly to the GBM antigen In contact, the ABM only dismisses its integrity when it is affected by certain external factors such as infection, smoking, suction gasoline or organic solvents, the undervisor antigen has a disorder, which is the most kidney Easy to be tired and the degree of accumulation is consistent with antibody titers, while the degree of lung accumulation is inconsistent with antibody titer.\nHLA-DR2 and other anti-primary frequencies such as HLA-DR2 in this disease (only 39%, normal control only 32%), and the length polymorphism analysis of gene DNA restriction fragment was also shown in this disease and HLA-DR4, HLA-DQ\u03b2 chain gene DQWLB and DQW3 is related to indicating that HLA secondary antigen related lymphocytes have a certain role in this disease. It has been experimentally found that if only the active animal anti-GBM antibody can produce GBM line shape, but does not occur, only simultaneous input After T cells were ill, thus confirmed that T cells played an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In recent years, research has also found that certain cytokines such as tumor necrosis factors, IL-1 can aggravate the development of this disease.\nThe pulmonary lesion is characterized by large blood spots, there are more blood spots in the surface, and there is a large amount of red blood cells under the geolar cavity, and many macrophage containing iron-containing macrophane, the alveolar wall is concentrated, fibrosis Alveolar cells are hypertrophic, and the electron microscope can be seen, and there is electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with normally, and the endothelial cells are normal, and the immunofluorescence examination shows that the capillary wall is IgG, C3 is continuous or discontinuous Deposition.\nKidney lesions can be seen in the double kidney soft and white, there are many small blood spots on the surface, and most of the variants of glossy nephritis is generally non-heavy, but the endothelium and measuring cell proliferation is generally not heavy, and the capillary cellulose sample is broken. Advanced glomerular fibrosis, kidney mass visible inflammatory cell infiltration and interstitial hemataritis, renal tubular degeneration, shrinking and necrosis, electron microscopy can be seen under the balloon under skin cell proliferation, forming a crescent body, a measuring matrix hyperplasia, substrate Membrane fracture, glomerular capillary walls generally do not have caused primary sediments, and there is an electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electron with electronically. IgG (100%), C3 (60% ~ 70%) along the glomerulus The capillary wall is linearly deposited, and the antibody IgG positive in the distal tubular base membrane is in some patients.\nIt is contemplated that the present epigenetic is mainly derived from the base film (GBM) antibody, and the immunofluorescence inspection indicates that IgG is deposited along the glomerular base membrane. The syndrome is diagnosed as pulmonary hemorrhage-nephritis syndrome, another patient Clinically, like pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome, but immunofluorescence shows that IgG is granular deposition along GMB, anti-GBM antibody is negative, and actually this part of the case is immunogenic nephritis (ICGN), autoimmune mechanism is in this disease The important role is that the ICGN is due to the corresponding part of the immune complex is deposited in the corresponding parts of glomeruli and alveolar. Before the clinical lung lesion occurs, the renal function is sharply deteriorated, which can be degraded in several months to several months. die.",

It is like a middle-aged middle-aged, and the male onset is 3 times that of women. The cause is not clear, and it is speculated that there are several factors: such as a large amount of dust suction (aluminum, silica, etc.), the body's immune function decreases (especially infant), genetic factors, alcohol abuse, microbial infection, etc. Although the starting factor is still unclear, basically consent to the pathogenesis of the disease is caused by disorders of lipid metabolism. That is, due to the body, the external factors cause the metabolic abnormality of the active substance of the alveolar surface. Pathological examination was characterized by protein-like substances filled with positive chip-chromatin (PAS) in alveoli, which was reported first by Rosen in 1958. Alveolar protein stains may have primary, secondary and congenital divisions depending on the cause. The clinical symptoms are mainly manifestinal, cough and cough, typical symptoms are imperative after the activity, and it will feel anxious when they are rest. The chest X-ray is a double lung diffuse pulmonary infiltration shadow. The diagnosis is mainly based on a bronchial alveolar, or has a pathological diagnosis in a fiberglass or a tab. The coughing was fixed by 80% ethanol, and the PAS was stained with 15% positive lipid. Trial protein dissolved enzyme atomized inhalation or intermittent positive pressure respirators. Branch tracheal pulmonary irrigation is the only treatment method that has been proven to be effective so far. Bronchial alveolar lavage is discharged from Bail, which will deposit the surface active material of the alveolar, thereby improving pulmonary ventilation and ventilation function, in many cases, only temporarily relieve symptoms, regularly repeatedly.",

    "cause": "The so-called immune function is a pathological character, and it is a point that body immunity is the ability of our body to resist violations in the face of external violations. For example, when there is an ubiquitous bacteria, when the stubborn virus is attacked to you, the good and bad of your body resistance can directly determine if you will be dyed.\nDrinking exceeds the right amount of drinking or general social drinking. Severe drinking is often determined based on a certain amount of alcohol (such as 3 standard cups per day) or each drink (such as a 5 standard cup, at least once a week).\nInheritance generally refers to the phenomenon of the traits of the parent, but in genetics refer to genetic substances from the upper generation to future generation.\nMicrobial infection refers to, infecting bacteria, mold, trichomonia, mycoplasma.\nA large amount of dust inhalation refers to the dust inhaled aluminum, silica.\n(1) Causes of the disease\nAlthough the starting factor is still unclear, basically consent to the abnormal abnormality of the lipid metabolic disorder, that is, due to internal and external factors, the metabolic abnormality of the alveolar surface active substance is basically, and there is more alveolar macrophages. Cell viability, animal experiments demonstrate that there is a significant decrease in dynamic fluid after macrophage phagocytosis, and the visual particles in the macrophage in the macrophage in the liquid can reduce normal cell viability. After the treatment of vaporial alveolar lavage, its alveolar macrophage viability It can be increased, and the study did not find that II cell generated protein increased, and the whole body lipid metabolism has no abnormalities, so it is generally considered that the disease is related to the decline in clearing capacity.\n(2) pathogenesis\n1. The pathogenesis of alveolar protein is not fully clear, there are several assumptions:\n(1) Surface active substance clearance is discovered that alveolar protein sediments and all lung lavagers are very similar to those of the alveolar surface active substance secreted by Type II pulp epithelial cells, suggesting alveolar protein deposition. The object may be related to the alveolar surface active material metabolism, most evidence that alveolar deposits may be caused by excessive alveolar surface active substances, rather than producing excessive, normal case of alveolar surface active substances (SP) With the removal of a complex dynamic process, alveolar type II epithelial cells are not only synthesized and secreted alveolar surface active substances, but also to alveolar macrophages involved in the removal of alveolar surface active materials, when certain factors such as infections, drugs, etc. The function of alveolaens II cells changes, resulting in a decrease in the removal ability of the active substance of the alveolar surface, which initiates deposition of surface active substances in the alveolar, and recent studies have also found that surfactant protein A (SP-a) is not only Adjusting the secretion of the surface active substance and also adjusts the re-intake of alveolar type II epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages to alveolar surface active substances, and its role in PAP pathogenesis is still unclear.\n(2) Evolux macrophage functional defects: many scholars have found that alveolar macrophages in patients with alveolar protein are low, phagocytic function, and phagocytic activity decline, Gonzalez, etc. When macrophages are cultured with alveolar lavage fluids in patients with alveolar protein, normal human alveoli macrophages will lose phagocytic ability, suggest that alveolar macrophages have inhibited alveolar macrophages in alveolar lavage fluids in patients with alveolar protein. Factors, the latest studies have shown that alveolar macrophage functional defects may be insufficiently related to granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or associated with GM-CSF / IL-3 / IL-5 receptor beta chain defects.\n(3) Secondary in other diseases: Clinically some diseases, especially blood system, especially blood system, may occur, such as myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, Fanconi anemia, IgG type immunoglobulin disease, etc., although literature reports blood system malignant The average incidence of secondary alveolar protein in tumors was about 5.3%, but the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia was as high as 10%, different from primary alveolar protein, and secondary alveolar protein The lesions of the disease tend to be a focal type, and the symptoms are slight, and it is usually not required to be treated with alveolar inveolar.\n(4) Abnormal injury of inhalation: Literature reported alveolar protein inhalation may be inhaled with certain physicochemical factors and mineral dust, such as white sinister, phenylbutanate, silicone and aluminum dust, etc. These can also cause alveolar protein stains that alveoliocritis may be related to certain physicochemical factors and mineral dust, but there is no direct evidence in humans and epidemiological studies indicate that alveolar protein deposition is related to the above substances.\n(5) Gene mutation: The alveolar surface active material-related protein B (SP-B) gene mutation has been confirmed to be related to congenital alveolar, CPAP, has confirmed that the SP-B gene has at least 2 mutation sites. One is that the 121-bit base C is replaced by 3 base GAA, and the other is the lack of one base T at the 122-bit point, and the two gene mutations can cause SP-B deletion in the active substance of the alveolar. However, the clinical manifestation of congenital alveolar protein deposition is very large, and there may be other sites or new SP gene mutations.\n(6) GM-CSF and its receptor abnormalities: 1994 Dranoff et al. Found that mice alveolar substance deposited in mouse mouse mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and there were many scholars. Studies have proven that patients with alveoliocytosis have the disorders of cytokine regulation balance, namely IL-10 expression and reduced GM-CSF expression and GM-CSF / IL-3 / IL-5 receptor beta chains. condition.\nIn summary, the pathogenesis of alveolar protein is still not fully understood that any of the above causes cannot completely explain all cases, and it is necessary to further study in the future.\n2. Pathological performance\n(1) Observation of the naked eye: most of the pulmonary is high, and the pleural can be seen as a yellow or gray yellow small nodule or small plaque, the nodule diameter is different from the number millimeter to 2cm, and the shank can be seen that the yellow liquid flows out, if not Combined infection, the pleural surface is smooth.\n(2) Luminous glasses examination: alveolar and fine branch tracheal cavity filled with phosphorous substance, alveolar spacer or increased alveolar segment, but there is no obvious fibrosis in interval, but there is no obvious fibrosis in intervals. In addition to occasionally discovering inflammatory performance in macrophages in addition to occasional macrophages.\n(3) Electron microscopy: There is a large number of layered structures in the alveolar fragments, which are composed of 3-layer phospholipids, which are structurally similar to alveolar surface active substances.",

The discharge, the pressure in the alveolar is increased, and the alveolar interval has gradually increased due to increased pressure in the bubble, which is a huge gas-containing pocket chamber, which is clinically referred to as pulmonary hazabs.\nIt is more singularly, and there is no obvious emphysema at the same time.\nSecondary in the emphyseta, often with the larger, except the bulke, often accompanied by most sputum.\n(2) pathogenesis\nThe walls of the pulmonary bulks are thin, consisting of alveolar flat epithelial cells or only fibrous films, can coexist with a variety of emphysema, common in interval or fine leaf lumps, can be accompanied or not with carbon At the end, it is seen in the coal mine workers dust and lung and scar tissue emphysema, and the pulmonary bulle is divided into three pathological forms.\nType I: More occurs in the middle or tongue, is also common in the lung leaves, may be due to the large pneumatic negative pressure, highlighting the lung surface, and there is a slope and lung, also known as a narrow bulla, because of the bronchial The vulnerability formed by the scar tissue, the volume of pulmonary bulb volume is thinner due to the alveolar side branch ventilation and gas retention, and the type I pulp is thin, and it is often formed by pleural and connective tissue. Conventional X-ray chest phleti can find the lungs The presence of bulss.\nType II: Between the tissue of the dirty pleuriso and the ioniculum tissue, the light lung sputum in the bottom of the width is located in the lung surface, and the lungs can be seen in the lung bulk cavity, but it does not constitute the wall of the lungs, Can be seen any part of the lung.\nIII: It is a deep pulmonary pacide in the bottom of the wide base, the structure is similar to the type II, but the part is deeper, and the surroundings are ionic pulmonary tissues. The pulmonary bulks can be extended to the lungs, which can be found in any lungs.\nWhen the lung bulks increases, the surrounding lung tissue is oppressed and causes lung shift. The pressure lung tissue is placed on the X-ray chest radiograph, which is expressed as the density of pulmonary bulke, and the above three types are seen in chronic bronchitis, more Related to chronic diffuse obstructing pulmonary disease, the small leaf-type emphysema does not have a lung pacib, and the lower leaf lung pacifia is common in coal and mine workers with concurrent disease and fusion silicone.",

The study of emphysema has proved that the concentration of the elastic polypeptide increases in patients with emphysema, and smoking can increase elastin solubility, inhibit the infiltration of fibroblasts of the pulmonary cells, resulting in increased tissue sensitivity to elastinase, inhibiting resistance The activity of elastase, these findings support smoking to break the balance of elastase and anti-elastases, resulting in damage to the fine structure of the lung, causing emphysema.\nPathogenesis\n1 Swell (often in the lung tip), all-leaf-type pulmonary emphysema (often in the bottom of the pulmonary base) and the distal leaflet type pulmonary immersion, all-small and leafy-type emphysema is related to smoking, these two types Emmonium is often combined and is evenly distributed in the upper leaf or lower leaf of the lung. When the emphysema is severe, the tracheal obstruction also has the development, and the inflammation of the anti-fracture trachee is caused by tracheal obstruction, and the tube is damaged. Mechanical support is lost, so that it collaps and tracheal obstruction, thereby causing increased intracellular gas to form a gas chamber.\n2, emphysema, physiology: respiratory muscles have obvious changes in emphysema patients, other respiratory auxiliary muscles, the intercostal muscles can also work on normal length-tension curves, and the degree of rumor of the diaphragm is reduced, so that In the case of shrinkage, there is no sufficient chest negative pressure. When the diaphragm is met, it pulls down the lower thoracic, extruded the lungs, and the effect of the breathing, and the thoracol is caused to cause suction when the diaphragm is contracted. The function is converted into exhalation, the damage of the pulmonary wall structure reduces the pulmonary blood tube bed, the damage of pulmonary microcirculation has increased lung vascular resistance, and the lung blood resistance of pulmonary blood flow is reversed in the lung CO diffusion capacity.

According to reports, hospitals with this program were compared with unspected hospitals, and the infection rate in the hospital was 20% low.\n2, gastrointestinal decontamination treatment is a precautionary measures commonly used in Europe, mainly for the susceptible crowd of infections in the hospital, with the aim of removing colonies and growth in the gastrointestinal colonies. Methods There are full gastrointestinal decontamination and selective gastrointestinal decontamination methods, which are commonly used, which uses polymyxin B, textamycin (gentamicin or new molds) through nasal feeding or oral gastrointestinal. Sui, et al. And a birutin B, for 5 days, and apply cefosporin, remove the oxygen in the oxygen in the gastrointestinal, without reducing the number of anaerobic bacteria, and does not reduce the amount of anaerobic bacteria without reducing the number of anaerobic bacteria. The bacilli is particularly obvious. According to the author's relevant literature, the pollution of almost nonsense pneumoniae and respiratory infection (individual is resistant strain infection).\n3, protecting the gastric acid barrier is mainly when preventing stress ulcers, using sulfur aluminum, which can prevent shoulder ulcer bleeding, and because it has adsorbed gastric mucosa, changing gastric mucus, increase In the gastric chamber, the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) content, the effect of absorbing the gastric protease does not change the gastric acid in the gastric environment, thereby effectively playing the effect of preventing ulcers and preventing infection. And according to the literature, the sulfide aluminum has an intrinsic bactericidal activity, and a series of studies have shown that the incidence of pneumonia in the antic acid group is 23% to 35%, and the incidence of pneumonia in aluminum group is 10% ~ 19. %.\n4. Biological prevention methods for biological prevention of pneumonia pneumonia pneumonia are still in the experimental stage. HELD et al., An IgM monoclonal antibody (mAb) produced from Pneumonia Krellia Poxy polysaccharide (CPS) induction to the experimental animal to prevent pneumoniae Krebacterial pneumonia, compared with the control group, regardless of organ accumulation rate, infection tissue The number of bacteria, the changes in tissue changes in lungs, and the prevention group is far better than the control group (P <0.01), but this MAB has no preventing the role of Pneumonia Krebacillus into the lungs, but accelerates the absorption of infection, Enhance the sorghum capacity of lungs. There are also similar experimental reports, but mature vaccines and antibodies have not been applied to clinical, and further research is needed. The pneumoniae Krebacterial pneumonia is harmful to humans. With the continuous improvement of scientific development, inspection and treatment means, humans have gradually deeply in-depth, it is believed that it can further reduce its incidence and mortality, and achieve greater improvement.",

    "cause": "The factors in the occurrence of pulmonary abscess are bacterial infections, bronchogenesis, plus systemic resistance, primary abscess is caused by inhaled pathogens or pneumonia, the secondary abscess is based on the existence of lesions (such as obstruction). It is caused by the spread of pulmonary spread, bronchial expansion, and (or) immunosuppressive state, common pathogenic factors:\n1, teeth, periodontal infection: unconscious, abuse of ethanol or sedative medicine, epilepsy, head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes coma, and other diseases caused by cough and reflection.\n2, swallow disorder: a benign or malignant stenosis, delayed paralysis, cardia, and pharyngeal supersses cause to cause accidental suction.\nThere are many bacteria that can cause pulmonary abscess, and mostly mixed infections, generally consistent with upper respiratory tract, orally alone bacteria, including oxygen, coherent anaerobic and anaerobic bacteria: such as pneumococcal, golden Staphylococcus, lysmal chain Strobacteria, Amorganism, Krepen bacillus, Escherichia coli, copper pseudomonas, deformation bacilli, etc .; anaerobic bacteria has auscine bacteria, stoclascis, and nuclear grain holder, etc., in recent years, the progress of training technologies, found Inhalation anaerobic infection rate is as high as 90%.\nThe occurrence and development of pulmonary abscesses often have the following three factors: 1 bacterial infection. 2 bronchure blocking. 3 The whole body resistance is reduced, and there are two categories: blood source infections and tracheal infections, blood source infections, mainly caused by sepsis and sepsis, and the lesions are widely used, mainly using drug treatment, tracheal infection The secretions from the respiratory or upper deception channels, in sleep, coma, drunken, anesthesia or epilepsy, after cerebral vascular accident, cause small bronchial obstruction, reduced in human resistance Pulmonary abscess will be induced.\nThe pneumotube obstructs the lung section of the long side of the bronchial obstruction and inflammation, which causes the lung segment of vascular embolization to produce lung tissue necrosis and liquefaction, and the surrounding pleural lung tissue has formed an inflammatory response, and finally forms a certain range of abscess, after abscess, after abscess, after passing In the acute and subaracressed stage, such as the bronchial drainage is not smooth, the infection control is not complete, then gradually transfer into a chronic stage, in the process of infection, the interlaced velocity, the tired lungs and bronchi are both destroyed, and there are organizational repairs; There is a lesion of lung tissue, and there is a lesion of bronchial pleurisy; there is both acute inflammation; there is chronic inflammation; it is mainly manifested as a sauce cavity in the lung tissue, and there is lung tissue and varying degree of fibrosis, related bronchiors Generate different degrees of obstruction and expansion.\nChronic pulmonal swells have three characteristics:\n1. The abscess is the top of the surface of the lung segment or pulmonary leaves at the beginning.\n2, the purulent mass is always connected to one or more small bronchoes.\n3, abscess spread out, until the late stage is not limited by the lung segment, the lung boundary limit, and can be across the bladder, form a destructive lesion of each other.\nCauses necrotic pneumonia. Such as urethral infections, abdominal pelvic absces, left heart intimaitis, infected with infection, infectious thrombotic vasculitis.\nSuch as bronchial expansion, bronchogenesis (tumor, foreign matter, innate abnormalities).\nPathogeneous mechanism:\nPulmonary abscess can be classified according to the onset time and pathogenic bacteria, acute pulmonary abscesses do not exceed 4 to 6 weeks, and chronic abscess is longer.\nInjection of bacterial contaminants into the lungs into the lungs, blocking a small or small bronchi, making the distal lungs, rapid growth of local bacteria, producing inflammation, small blood vessels, lung tissue very fast and necrosis, about 1 week later Insensicum, the salad, the sap, the surrounding small bronchi, the pus can be discharged from the atmosphere, form a pus cavity, the size of the size, single or more, can occur in any part of the pulmonary, multiple small abscess (<2cm) The formation is associated with pneumonia or lung, some necrosis after the abscess is half solid mass, and the pus is not discharged to the bronchial, it is very like a tumor, abscess is mostly under the sharp edge of the lungs, but due to the early inflammation, there is an inflammation There is not much to break the pleura into a suppurate or pye chest, in the acute phase, such as drainage, and the proliferation, plus drug treatment, lesion can be gradually healed, leaving a small amount of fiber tissue, such as bacterial poison, not appropriate The bronchial drainage is not smooth, and the lesion is expanded. The pulmonary splitting is very small, the lesion is often invaded, and the neighbor segment and the adjacent leaves, even the wavefront, the broncho is blocked, and the tension cavity can be formed. Drain the chest.\nIf the acute abscess has not been controlled in time, the pulmonary inflammation and the anchor can be delayed to 2 to 3 months, it has become chronic pulmonary abscess, the pulmonary is destroyed, and the sinus of the middle, the lesion is in destruction. Some organizational repairs, the sauce is more thick, the bronchi is inflammatory infringement and the opening block, which produces different degrees of expansion, abscess can be in a stationary state, or because the sputum is overflowing, the infection spread, lung tissue Fibrosis shrinks, pleura due to repeated inflammation forming a close adhesion, body circulation and pulmonary cycle form many vascular communication, there is a coarse blood vessel in adhesion, even in the body surface can also hear systolic or continuous vascular murmur (pleura adhesion noise) The adhesion of the lung door is very tight, and the bronchial artery is increased.\nGravity and misunderstanding position is the determination factor in the lung segment of the lesion, so the two lower lungs and the upper right leaf, the outer subparague of the back is in a mistake, 85% of the lung abscess, and the lung abscess occurred in the lung abscess. The left side of the right side is mostly the most common in the lower leaf segment, because the right total bronch and the mid-angle are small, and the coarse, contaminants are easy to enter, the same reason, the lower leaf segment, the upper leaf, \"Oddle Section\" is a multi-hamit, in the right front section, lung abscess occurs in the middle, and the tongue, should suspect inducement of tracheal obstruction or abnormal swallowing abnormalities.",

    "prevent": "Although the plug of pulmonary embolism can be derived from any body vein system and the right heart room, but most from the deep veins from the lower limbs. Therefore, the most important prevention of pulmonary embolism is for lower thrombotic veneeritis and thrombosis, actively medical foot infection (including pedicure) and anti-venous collections; Antibiotics and anticoagulants are simultaneously applied.\nAfter surgery and trauma should reduce bed time, encourage early bed activities; if you need long-term bedrings, you should regularly do lower limbs proactive and passive activities to alleviate blood stagnation. In addition to active treatment of cardiopulmonary infrastructure, patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease should also reduce the in-bed, thrombosis or embolism evidence. Long-distance ride, the passenger should eventually active lower limbs in a timely manner to prevent thrombosis.\nSuspected venous thrombosis or thrombotic venous inflammation can do lower limbs impedance volume map, vascular ultrasonic Doppler, radionuclide or conventional venous angiography, etc. to diagnose, early treatment. For \"primary\" (hereditary) high-rise or deep vein thrombosis-pulmonary embolism family history, the defects of the coagulation mechanism should be checked and found, such as ATII, C protein, s protein and fibrinogenase Lack, etc., it should be anticillied with life after the onset, and the lower chamber vena cavity is actively installed.\nThe key to prevent pulmonary embolism is to prevent primary diseases.",
    "cause": "Thrombus formation of pulmonary embolism is often a merger of venous thrombosis. The plug is typically derived from the deep veins of the lower extremities and pelvic, causing embolifiers by circulating to pulmonary artery; but rarely derived from upper limbs, heads and neck veins. Blood flow sludge, increased blood coagulation and venous endothelial damage are the promotion factors of thrombosis. Therefore, trauma, long-term bed, varicose veins, venous cannula, pelvic and hip surgery, obesity, diabetes, contraceptive or other reason, etc., it is easy to induce venous thrombosis. Early thrombus slabs, plus the role of the fibrilic system, so the risk of pulmonary embolism is the highest in the initial number of thrombosis.\nHeart disease is the most common cause of my country's pulmonary embolism, accounting for 40%. A few times and a variety of heart disease, combined atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and acute bacterial endometric inflammation. Up to the right heart thrombosis, a few are also derived from the vein system. Bacterial ketchings are in addition to subacute bacterial endocarditis, can also be caused by pacemaker infection. The former infectious plug mainly comes from three-pointed valve, and occasionally, the two-pointed biological canopy can be reached into the pulmonary artery from the left heart defect.\nThe tumor is the second reason for my country, accounting for 35%, far from 6% abroad. It is more common with lung cancer, digestive system tumors, cashmers, leukemia, etc. The malignant tumor is only about 1/3 of the pulmonary embolization, and the rest are thrombosis. It is proposed to speculate that there may be probative kinase (THROMOPLASTIN) and other substances that activate the coagulation system such as histone, tissue protease and proteolytic enzyme, etc.\nPregnancy and childbirth roublock in pregnant women have the highest incidence after postpartum and laparotomy. In pregnancy, intraperitoneal internal pressure increase and hormone relaxation angioplasmic muscle and basin intravenous pressure can cause slow blood flow, change blood flow change characteristics, and increase venous thrombosis. In addition, the increase in blood circulation and platelets, the activity of plasma plasma-plasma protein dissolution system is reduced; however, these changes have no absolute differences compared to the pregnant women of thromboembolic plugs; amniotic fluid embolism is also a serious complications during childbirth.\nOther rare causes have long bone fracture fat embolism, accidents and decompression diseases cause air embolism, parasites and foreign body embolism. When there is no obvious factor, it is also considered that hereditary anticoagulant is reduced or increased by fibrinogen activation inhibitors.\nPathological changes\nMost acute pulmonary embolism can accumulate multi-pulmonary arteries, and the part of embolism is more than left in the right lung, and the lower leaf is more than the upper leaf; however, there is a rare embolism in the right or left ventricular trunk or ride over the pulmonary artery. When the thrombus is mechanized, the surface of the heart is gradually covered with the surface of the heart, and it is firmly attached to the arterial wall after 2 to 3 weeks, and blood vessel reconstruction. Early plug retraction, blood flow retransmate, covering cellulose, platelet trays and thrombolytic processes on the surface of the plug, can produce new plugs to further embolize small blood vessel branches. Whether the plug causing pulmonary infarction, the capacity of the blood flow, the blocked range, and the bronchial artery supply, and whether the ventilation region is properly determined.\nThe histological characteristics of the pulmonary infarction are the blood bleeding and alveolar walls in alveolar, but rarely find inflammation. There is a minority when there is no pulmonary infection or plug in non-infectivity. The loss of active substances in the lung surface of the infarction area can lead to the loss of the lung, and the pleural surface is common, 1/3 is blood. If you can survive, the infarct area finally forms a scar.\nAfter pulmonary embolism, the physiological dead cavity is increased, and the ventilation efficiency is lowered, but since the acute pulmonary embolism can stimulate ventilation, increase the breathing frequency and the amount of ventilation per minute, usually offset the increase in the physiological dead chamber, and maintain PACO2 does not rise even decrease.\nExcessive ventilation and hypoxiamia are not related to hypoxiamia, and it cannot be eliminated by oxygen; the mechanism is not clear, and it is speculated that the reflection of the lung substance in the vascular embolization region is speculated. Although PACO2 is usually reduced, neuromuscular disease, severe pain and pulmonary embolism are severely increased, and CO2 retention can occur when the ventilation compensation is increased.\nAcute pulmonary embolism, PAO2 is often lowered, and the ventilation / blood flow ratio disorder may be its main mechanism, local bronchial contraction, lungs and pulmonary edema are the foundation of its anatomical basis. If the amount of cardiac output cannot be consistent with metabolism, the mixed venous blood oxygen partial pressure will be reduced, and the ventilation / blood flow ratio disorder and hypoxemia can be further aggravated.",

    "cause": "SARS coronavirus infection is its direct cause.\n(1) epidemiology\nClassical coronavirus infection is mainly in the winter and spring season, widely distributed around the world, the virus consists of three groups, first, two groups mainly for mammalian coronaviruses, the third group mainly includes poultry coronaviruses, human coronavirus has two Blood-shaped (HCO-229E, HCOV-OC43), is an important pathogen of human respiratory tract infection, and 20% of human beings are caused by coronaviruses. The coronavirus is also an important cause of acute and aggravation of adult chronic trachea. Genomics The results show that SARS-COV genes are different from those of known three groups of classic coronaviruses. The first group of virus serum can react with SARS-COV, while serum serum from patients with SARS can't react with known coronavirus, so As a new coronavirus, SARS-COV can be classified as a fourth group.\n(2) morphological structure\nSARS-COV crosoproscopy crosophytes, is an envelope virus, has a diameter of 60-120 nm, and there is an emission arrangement on the envelope or fiber-like protrusions, a length of 20 nm or longer, a narrow base, and a crown. Similar to classic coronaviruses, the morphological process of viruses is longer, and mature viruses have a big difference in size and morphology, and there are many quirky and unripe virus. Forms, such as renal sham, drum shavings, horseshoe, bell shaped, etc., it is easy to confuse with the cavity, on the size, the viral particles reduce 400 nm from the beginning to 60-120 nm in the late maturity, in the patient's corpse anatomical specimen slice Variety of viral particles can be seen.\n(3) biological characteristics\nThe virus proliferates in the cytoplasm, and the multistozyme encoded by the RNA gene is used to use the cell material for RNA replication and protein synthesis, assembled into a new virus and secreted into the cells, and different coronavirus discovered, using Vero-E6 or VERO (green monkey) Nephocytes) The cells are easily separated from SARS-COV. The virus grows well under 37 \u00b0 C, and the cell infection can occur 24 hours, and the virus titration can be performed, and the culture titer of the early separation strain is generally up to 1. \u00d7 106PFU / ml, in RD (human horns-angry tumor cells), MDCK (dog renal cells), 293 (human embryonic renal cells), 2BS (human embryonic cells), etc. can also be cultivated, but the titer is low .\nThe virus at room temperature at least 10 days in the urine, and can survive for more than 5 days in the sputum and feces of patients with diarrhea, 15 days in blood, in plastic, glass, mosaic, metal, cloth, photocopying Many objects such as paper can survive 2-3 days.\nThe virus is sensitive to temperature, decreased by rising temperature, 37 \u00b0 C can survive 4 days, 56 \u00b0 C heating for 90 minutes, 75 \u00b0 C heating for 30 minutes to inactivate viral, and ultraviolet light irradiate for 60 minutes to kill viruses.\nThe virus is sensitive to organic solvents, and the ether can completely inactivate viruses at 4 \u00b0 C for 24 hours, 75% ethanol can make viral loss vibrant, and chlorine-containing disinfectant can inactivate viruses.\n(4) Molecular biological characteristics\nThe viral genome is a single stranded RNA, consisting of approximately 30,000 nucleotides, only about 60% homology with classic coronavirus, but the genome is similar to other coronaviruses, and the genome is in turn from 5 to 3. : 5'-polyzyme-SEMN-3, 5 terminal has a methylated hat structure, which is followed by 72 nucleotide guidance sequences, and the genomic RNA is about 2/3 is an open news reporter frame (ORF) 1A / 1B, encoding RNA polyserases (REP), the protein directly translated from genomic RNA, forming a polyprotein precursor, and the latter further is cut by viral main protease 3ClPro, mainly responsible for virus transcription and copying, 4 people in the downstream of REP, encoding S, respectively E, M and N are structural proteins, which are translated from the subgenatory mRNA, and the subgenatory mRNA is synthesized by a mechanism of discontinuous transcription, and its transcription is started by the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS), the latter conservative sequence is aaacgaac, a genome There is a Polya tail at the 3rd side.\nThe viral envelope is a double lipid film, and the outer membrane protein includes glycoprotein S, M and a small casing E protein, and M glycoprotein is different from other coronavirovirus glycoproteins, only short amino terminal domains are exposed to viral encapsulating. Outside, long and curved spiral nest fabric structures consist of a single molecule genomic RNA, multi-molecule alkaline N protein, and M protein carboxy terminals, S proteins are responsible for cell adhesion, membrane fusion and induction neutralizing antibodies, relative The molecular mass is about 150,000-180000, including the cytoplasmic domain of the extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and the shortboxylast end of the shortboxylate, and the e-protein and M protein may make the minimum assembly unit, and the E protein is used to play the virus. The key role, M protein plays an important role in the stability of the core of the virus, and is different from other coronaviruses, between S and E (X1-274AA, X2-154AA) and M and N (X3-63AA, X4-122AA, X5-84AA) There are more than 50 amino acid polypeptides in the coding sequence, M and N, and a polypeptide in which 50 amino acids is less than 50 amino acids, and homologous search results show that these potential polypeptides and any other protein There is no sequence similarity.\nAt present, domestic and foreign scientists have reported the total genome sequence of multi SARS-COVs, found that there is no high variation, from 4 Singapore, 1 plant in Canada, 1 plant in the United States, Hong Kong, my country, 1 plant in Beijing and Guangdong 1 plant 129 variations were found in a total of 13 virus strains. According to their evolutionary trees, the current populations can be divided into two genome: a group included 4 poisonous strains in Beijing (BJ01-BJ04), 1 plant in Guangzhou (GZ01) And 1 poisonous strain (CUHK) assay in Hong Kong Chinese University, other strains belong to another group, analyzing the variation characteristics of viruses, possibly providing clues for tracking virus sources.\n(5) Immunological characteristics\nIn most cases, when SARS-COV is infected, the body's immune system can stimulate body fluid immunity and cellular immune response and gradually control infection, remove viruses, have many evidence that SARS-COV is infected, human immune system can excite humoral immunity and cells The immune response and gradually control infection, remove the virus, there are many evidence that SARS-COV can directly invade the immune system, leading to patient lymphocytes, leukocyte reduction and peripheral lymphatic tissue, most SARS patient peripheral blood white cell count is normal or decreased, And CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, T lymphocytes are significantly lower than normal, and the closer condition, the more obvious the decrease in T lymphocyte count, and the number of T lymphocytes gradually returns to normal after the SARS patient recovers, and the SARS-CoV nucleic acid is generally 5 days after clinical symptoms can be detected from the patient's nasopharyngeal extract, the peak is reached around the 10th day, and then it is reduced; 21 days, 47% of the patient's nasopharyngeal extract is positive, 67% fecal specimen is positive, 21 The% urine specimen is positive, and N protein can induce a strong immune response, which can be used for antibody detection, and the detection of antibody indicates that 1 week after the disease, the patient's body is beginning to produce, up to 3 months; 7- The IgG began to generate around 10 days, then gradually increased, 1 month of antibody titers reached peak and all of them, and 6 months after the patient's recovery continued to high levels, SARS is a new and exemption, people are generally easy Sense, epidemiological data showed that SARS-COV mainly caused significant infection, still lacking evidence of subclinical infection. After the SARS epidemics, the immuno-protective barrier is not formed in the crowd, and the crowd is still generally susceptible to detect patient serum. SARS-VOV-specific antibodies help clinical diagnosis.\nSARS is a new infectious disease caused by SARS-COV. People are not clear about their pathogenesis. Some threads are mainly from the corpse data from SARS death cases, ultrastructure research, nucleic acid level SARS- COV detection and clinical data of patients with SARS, many aspects of understanding are still speculated, and will inevitably be affected by treatment measures.\nSARS-COV enters the human body by the respiratory tract, replicated within the respiratory mucosal epithelium, further causing viral blood disorder, virus-infected cells include tracheal bronchi epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, intestinal epithelial cells, Reherent trail epithelial and lymphocytes, alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vascular endothelial cells can damage the risk of breathing film blood gas barriers, accompanied by inflammatory congestion, causing a large amount of exudation, exudation of the slurry and fibrinogen Fibrin agglutination is collected by cellulose, and thereby forming a transparent film together with necrotic alveolar epithelia.\nThe reaction of the body on SARS-COV infection can be manifested in pulmonary inter-mass macrophages and lymphocytes, activated macrophages and lymphocytes can release cytokines and free radicals, further increase the permeability of alveolar capillary And induced fibroblast proliferation, damaged alveolar epithelial cells fall into the alveolar cavity to form scavenging alveolabial inflammation, and contain multiple macrophages in the alveolar chamber, hyperplasia, exulve pulmonary epithelial cells and macrophages can form giant Cells, for giant cell phenotype, mainly alveolar epithelial cell sources (AE1 / AE3 positive), a small number of macrophage sources (CD68 positive), giant cell formation may be related to SARS-CoV infection, because in vitro experiment It is proved that SARS-COV infection can cause Vero cells to form a mixed cell, and the above changes in the lungs conform to the diffuse alveolar Damage, DAD 's exudation period change, patients with severe disease or poor resumption, then DAD proliferation And fibrocytes, and produce type I and type III collagen fibers, intestinal epithelial cells and renal distal tube epithelial cells infected by SARS-COV, on one hand, can explain some clinical patients with digestive tract symptoms, and on the other hand There is a sense of meaning in the spread path of disease.\nDue to the decrease in blood oxygen saturation in DAD and diffuse pulmonary, as well as factors such as vascular endothelial cell injury, it is often caused by multi-organ failure, resulting in multi-organ failure.\nSARS patients decreased, especially the number of CD4 + cells decreased, and there was evidence that SARS-COV direct infection of lymphocytes, may be related to SARS-COV cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis, Kjqdsars patients with body fluid immune response It seems normal, but from the perspective of the recovery of serum from SARS patients, SARS-COV infection will affect the body-liquid immune response varying degrees. SARS-COV affects cellular immunity and body fluid immune responses in the process of development in SARS. A certain role, at least means that the prognosis of patients with cellular immunity and body fluid immune injury.\nThe materials on SARS biopsy and autopsy are limited, so the awareness of their pathological changes is also very limited, based on current autopsy materials and small bronchial biopsy, SARS mainly involves lung and immune organs such as spleen and lymph nodes, other organs, liver, The kidney, adrenal, brain, etc. also have different degrees of damage,\nPulmonary: generally significantly expandable, swollen, weight increase , Can be tired of all leaves of the full lung, the hepatothenesis of the large leaf pneumonia, the red brown or dark purple, the secondary infection can have a magnitude unequal abscess, and thrombosis visible in the pulmonary vascular, some cases can occur The lung infarction of the area, which can be seen in some cases.\nLight mirror observation: The lesion of the lungs is usually more tight, almost all of the lungs, mainly manifested as a change in hematly alveolar injury, depending on the difference in the period of lesions, there can be as follows: 10 days of course is mainly pulmonary edema, fiber Sui seepage, transparent film formation, alveolar macrophage accumulation and hyperplasia II pulmonary epithelial cells to fall into the defensive pneumonia formed by the alveoli, which is not only visible in the autopsy specimen, but also There is also the same lesion change in the fibrous bronchoscopic lung biopsy material, and some hyperplasia is fused, and the proprietary multi-core vital cells are mixed, and the virus can be seen in the cytoplasmic of the hyperplasia of alveolar epithelials and exudated monocytes. The inclusion body, with the progression of the lesion, often visible in the case of alveolar exudation, the mechanization of the transparent film and the mechanization of the transparent film and the alveolar cell proliferation of the alveolar, and finally forming alveolar Closure and shrinking, leading to the real transformation of all lungs, only some cases have obvious fiber proliferation, leading to pulmonary fibrosis or even hardened, and intrammonic small blood vessels can often be seen in cellulosecymic micro thrombosis, and the above lesion can have a lot of patients. Differences, even in the lungs of the same patient can also be seen in different periods, some cases, especially long-term patients, often visible in small leaf pneumonia and even large-scale fungal infections, which are most common in terms of Aspergillus infection, follow Hair infection can be tired and pleural, resulting in pleural effusion, pleura adhesion, and even pleural cavity occurs.\nLymph node (abdominal lymph node lymph nodes): some cases can be seen in lymph nodes, almost all of the lymph node lymphoid films underground have different degrees of shrinking or disappearance, lymphocyte distribution, reduction, blood vessels and lymphoid Expanded congestion, sinus tissue cells significantly, some disease you can see blood and necrosis.",

Adhere to the medical examination can be made by early hair, early treatment.\nhealth education\n1, prohibit and control smoking\nNo smoking is prohibited, first focusing on reducing the ratio of smokers in the population, requiring certain legal or regulations to restrict people, especially restricting adolescent smoking.\n2, control atmospheric pollution\nDo a good job in environmental protection, effectively control atmospheric pollution, thereby achieving the purpose of preventing lung cancer.\n3, occupational protection\nFor mining radioactive ore, effective protection measures should be taken to minimize the amount of radiation of the staff, and workers who are exposed to carcinogenic compounds must take a variety of practical labor protection measures to avoid or reduce contact with carcinogenic factors. .\n4, prevention and treatment of chronic bronchitis\nDue to the incidence of lung cancer in patients with chronic bronchitis, the incidence of chronic bronchitis is actively prevented to prevent chronic bronchitis has certain significance, especially to persuade smokers who have chronic bronchitis, because of chronic bronchitis The incidence of lung cancer in the smoking crowd is higher.\n5, early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment\nScreening methods for early lung cancer are still unsatisfactory, and the cost of lung cancer in the population is very expensive, and the possibility of reducing lung cancer mortality is small.\nStudies use chemical prevention, such as using epoxidase (COX) inhibitors, fat oxygenase inhibitors, etc., some of the vitamin E, carotenoids, retrailoid, selenium, etc. There is also a preventive role.",

In 1924, Moller coated with tar as a rabbit back, and found that the incidence of lung cancer increased slightly, and currently, smoking is the most basic high risk factor of lung cancer. More than 3,000 chemicals in tobacco, multi-chain aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (such as benzopyrene) have strong carcinogenic activity, can act on certain special enzymes in human tissue (especially lung tissue), producing cells Molecular structure (such as DNA) mutation may have K-RAS mutations.\nIt is estimated that there is a history of environmental and occupational contact history, there is enough evidence to confirm the incidence of the following 9 industrial components to increase lung cancer: aluminum products by-products, arsenic, asbestos, bis-chloromethyl ether, chromium compound, coke furnace, Mustard, nickel impurities, vinyl chloride, long-term contact, cadmium, silicon, formalin, etc. also increase the incidence of lung cancer, in addition, air pollution, especially industrial exhaust gas is high risk factors of lung cancer.\nUranium and fluorine miners contact inert gas helium, decay uranium by-products, etc., more than other people's lung cancer is significantly higher, but the person ionizing radiation does not increase lung cancer.\nSuch as pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchial expanded disorder, etc., bronchial epithelials may be laborary epithelials during chronic infection, and the cancer changes, but this kind is less.\nFamily, genetic and congenital factors and immune function reduction, metabolism, endocrine dysfunction, etc. may also be high risk factors of lung cancer.\nThe incidence of lung cancer in industrial developed countries is high, and the city is higher than rural areas. The main cause is due to industrial and transportation developed regions, oil, coal and internal combustion engines and asphalt road dust containing benzophenamy. Hydrocarbons such as harmful substances are polluted atmospheric, and investigating materials indicate that the incidence of lung cancer has also increased in the region of the concentration of phenyl in the atmosphere, and the incidence of gas pollution and stripping cigarettes may be promoted to each other.\nPathogenesis\nThe transfer of lung cancer has the following four ways:\n1, directly spread\nCanceruma continues to grow, can block the bronchial lumen while expanding the lung tissue outside the bronchial, near the lung peripheral tumor invades the pleural and chest wall, central or near tumors more inviolabile pleural and chest wall, central or Near the tumors can invade other organs, huge tumors can occur in partial ischemic necrosis, forming cancer voids.\n2, blood transfer\nIt is the advanced performance of lung cancer, and cancer cells can be transferred to any part of the body, and the common metastasis, the bone cool system, the adrenal, kidney and pancreas.\n3, broncho-spread\nAlveolar cell carcinoma cases, fine branch tracheal and cancer cells on the alveolar wall are easily detached; cancer cells can spread into adjacent lung tissues via a bronchial pipe to form a new cancer.\n4, lymphatic transfer\nThe lymphatic lungs of the lungs have a certain regular right lung on the right lungs and the left, the right lung flows, the lower right lobes, the lymph nodes of the lower Leaves total, the lower right upper, the lower right, the left, the right lung, the lower left, lower Yehui Tutal, Bulk, Under Pulmon Ligte, and Right Machiner lymph nodes, left lungs, lymph nodes, left front, longitudinal lymph nodes, left lungs, lymphatic flow to Upper Yehui Region, Bulk and Crossing It can be displayed in the upper right oriented lymph node, such as lymph node transfer (N state) using lymphoid lung cancer using a Mao Shaofu.\nLung cancer histological classification: Main lung cancer pathological types are divided into two major categories of small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, WHO histopathology classification is based on mirror indicators and refer to the comparative, immunocealization, electron microscopy, etc. .",

The cadmium compound absorbs 5% to 7% in the gastrointestinal tract, and the rest is discharged from the feces. The absorbed cadmium is mainly discharged from the kidney, and the milk is also discharged, cadmium. The fetus can be affected by the placenta, the cadmium absorbed in the body is very slow, only 50% in 10 years.\nCadmium enters the blood to form a cadmium metal mercaptoprotein (MT), about 70% in red blood cells, 30% in plasma, and 30% in plasma, with three cadmium peaks according to the blood gel chromatography. The MT-CD accounts for about 65%, respectively, and the polymer protein binding cadmium (HMWP-CD) accounts for 5% of the non-protein small molecule cadmium binding (LMW-CD); cadmium in red blood cells In addition, there is about 5% of hemoglobin binding cadmium (HB-CD), of which HMWP-CD has the main toxic effect. Cadmium in systemic tissue is mainly through blood circulation, and cadmium from plasma is released to the tissue, mainly in the liver. Kidney, intrahepatic cadmium content increases over time, while the kidney cadmium content is gradually increased, accounting for about 1/3 of total cadmium, cadmium to tissue is through cadmium and calcium competing and calcium modes (Calmolulin, CAM) Combined, interfering CAM and its physiological, biochemical system, causing Ca2 + -ATPase and phosphatase activity inhibition, microtubule in cytoplasma affects cytoskeletal, stimulating artery blood-slip muscle cells cause blood pressure, cadmium It also stimulates the activity of cantamine synthase to increase the level of dicamine, inhibits Na +-K + -Tp enzyme, zinc-containing enzyme, amino acid decarboxylase, histidine enzyme, amylase, peroxidase, and the like.\nIn particular, the luminamyl amino peptidase is inhibited, and the protein is decomposed. The kidney is a primary excretion of cadmium, so that cadmium is further stood, when uric cadmium is 2 \u03bcg / g creatinine, urine 6-keto-prostaglandin 1a (6-ketone -Pgf1a) and sialic acid levels have begun to increase significantly; 4 \u03bcg / g creatinine, renal tube antigen BBA, N-acetyl-beta-amino glucosidase (NAG), intestinal phosphatase (IAP), albumin and The concentration of iron protein is raised in the urine; when 10 \u03bcg / g creatinine is reached, serum \u03b22 microglobulin (\u03b22mg) and \u03b22 mg, THG) and glucose aminamine (gag) are elevated. The above indicators reflect the change in cadmium to cause renal chemistry, the function of renal biochemistry, the damage of renal tubular barrier, damage and dysfunction, cadmium also causes hepatocyte damage, causing abnormal liver function; hindering the absorption of iron to iron.

    "cause": "Exactly, due to unclear, it may be the result of a variety of causes, which is generally considered to be related to the following factors:\nRespiratory infection, especially with influenza virus infection is the most common cause of this disease. Recent studies have found that patients with sexually transmitted immunodeficiency patients infected with PneumoCystis Carinii Pneumonia, the body is prone to anti-GBM antibody, Calderon and other reports 4 Example HIV-infected people 3 anti-IV collagen \u03b13 chain antibody (anti-GBM antibody) positive, suggesting alveolar damage in pulmonary hematocysts, can induce pulmonary hemorrhage-nephritis syndrome.\nContact gasoline steam, hydroxylate, train oil, and inhalation of various hydrocarbons. Inhalation of these substances may trigger GoodPasture syndrome, but also pay more attention to preventive measures.\nPatients with long-term smoking in PEREZ have occurred after 3 weeks of sucking cocaine.\nPathogenesis\nSince some cases cause the body to generate an anti-pulley, the glomerular base film antibody is generated, and thereby attacks glomerulos and lungs, a type II metamorphosis reaction occurs, as for the simultaneous immune complex to the alveolar and glomerulane. There is no exact explanation of the pathogenesis of complement (III-type metamorphosis).\n1962 Steblay et al. Confirmed that the lung bleeding-nephritis syndrome of the glomerular base membrane (GBM) damage was mediated by anti-GBM antibody, and a large number of research work after subsection focused on separation and studying the GBM component, looking for antibodies The corresponding antigen and the molecular structure and characteristics of the antigen, in recent years, with the rapid development of molecular biology and biochemistry, in the \u03b13 (IV) chain of newly discovered collagen IV, NC1 domains of the \u03b13 (IV) chain It is a GoodPasture autogen, also known as the GoodPasture antigen, which cloned the antigen gene CO14A3, positioned in the second chromosome Q35 to 37 region.\nIt is confirmed that indirect immunofluorescence and immuno electron microscopy techniques are confirmed that GoodPasture antigen is not only seen in GBM, but also distributed in a renal tubular film (TBM), alveolar capillary film (ABM) and other tissue base films (such as choroid, corneal, crystal, retinal vessel) Base film, etc.), but the goodPasture antigen having a pathogenic action is mainly distributed in the reversibility of GBM, TBM, and ABM, antigen, which can expose the reversibility of its exposure process. In vitro, the \u03b13nc1 structure can be exposed by 6 mol hydrochloride or pH 3. Domain, but in vivo antigen is exposed and produced immune response injury GBM has not been fully understood. It is now speculated that the GoodPasture antigen hide in the collagen IV\u03b13nc1 domain under physiological conditions, various induced factors (toxins, viral infections, bacterial infections, tumors, Immunoma-genetic factors) and endotoxs can activate epithelium, endothelium and membrane cell proliferation, and release inflammatory media (IL-1, RDS, prostaglandin, neutral protease, etc.), GBM, etc. under cell enzyme, collagen IV Advanced Structure Decoction, Exposure of the GoodPasture antigen determinant, stimulating the body to produce antibody, resulting in immunization damage, due to the endothelial layer of the glomerular capillaries in the whole body capillary capillary, so that the antibody can be directly directly to the GBM antigen In contact, the ABM only dismisses its integrity when it is affected by certain external factors such as infection, smoking, suction gasoline or organic solvents, the undervisor antigen has a disorder, which is the most kidney Easy to be tired and the degree of accumulation is consistent with antibody titers, while the degree of lung accumulation is inconsistent with antibody titer.\nHLA-DR2 and other anti-original frequencies such as HLA-DR2 in this disease (only 32% of normal controls) were significantly higher polymorphism analysis, and HLA-DR4, HLA-DQ\u03b2 chain gene DR4, HLA-DQ \u03b2 chain gene DR4, HLA-DQ, and DQW3 is related to indicating that HLA secondary antigen related lymphocytes have a certain role in this disease. It has been experimentally found that if only the active animal anti-GBM antibody can produce GBM line shape, but does not occur, only simultaneous input After T cells were ill, thus confirmed that T cells played an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In recent years, research has also found that certain cytokines such as tumor necrosis factors, IL-1 can aggravate the development of this disease.",

Timely clearance and recycle the residue remaining on the desktop, ground, and the wall. Periodically determine the mercury concentration in the air in the air. The mercury operation workers should check once a year, and timely discovery of mercury absorption and early mercury poisoning patients, so as to treat early, mercury-containing exhaust gas, wastewater, waste sagging to handle it.\nThe treatment method at home mercury leak is: If there is liquid, the sulfur powder should be sprinkled above, let it respond; if you have volatilized, pay attention to indoor ventilation, you can't use your hand to contact mercury, and mercury will alleviate skin.\nMetal mercury was adhered to the surface of the object and continued to evaporate at room temperature. Therefore, the walls of the mercury work work, the surface and the surface of the work desk should be smooth without cracking, which is easy to clean and dismissions.

It is mainly caused by the increase in lung expansion or the increase in airway resistance. Normal lung expansion relies on breathing center driving, nerve conduction, suction The expansion of muscle shrinkage, diaphragm decreases, thoracolum and alveolar, the obstacles such as respiratory central inhibition, respiratory muscle fatigue, thoracic and lungs, etc. can result in lung expansion, and restriction alveolar ventilation, The obstructive alveolar ventilation is due to increased airway resistance.\n(2) ventilation barrier:\n1 Ventilation blood flow ratio disorders: ratio <0.8 is seen in pulmonary edema, pneumonia, pulmonary, etc.;\n2 disruption barriers: seeing the thickening of breathing film (such as pulmonary edema) and the reduction in the area (such as the lungs, the pulmonary variation), or the pulmonary blood tube is insufficient (emphysema) and blood oxygenation rate slower (anemia) Wait.\nThe characteristics of blood gas change caused by simple ventilation disorders: only PAO2 decreases, PACO2 is normal or decreased; the alveolar gas-arterial blood oxygen division P (A-a) O2 is increased.\n(3) Oxygen consumption increases: fever, difficulty breathing, convulsions, etc. can increase oxygen consumption, which is an important reason for adding deficiency.\n2. The level of mechanism of CO2 retention is dependent on the amount of production and discharge of CO2. The production of CO2 increases, such as fever, hyperthyroidism, etc. Therefore, PACO2 is the best indicator reflecting the amount of lungs, which must have insufficient alveolar ventilation.",

Pneumophil, LP) and Mai's Legion (P.Micdadei); 15 serotypes of the Trichoprobi Legiongi, about 90% of serum type I, military pylori is Gram-negative bacilli, (0.3 ~ 0.9) \u03bcm \u00d7 (2 ~ 4) \u03bcm, the occasional filament, there is a flage, most is one, located at the top, oxygen, powered, the pathogen is not grown in ordinary medium, the most suitable medium is medicine With cargo-yeast leaching agaric (BCYE), colony is grown after 2 to 4 days, a diameter of 1 to 2 mm, flat or micro-convex, and neatly neatly, in FG (FeElease-Gorman agar medium, 3 to 5 days culture visible Needle tip size, a yellow fluorescence can be emitted under ultraviolet irradiation, and most strain catalase weak positive, nitrate enzymes and urea enzymes are negative, and only the starch is used to adversely use other saccharides, and the biochemical identification is generally identified. Large, often based on growth and form, and finally serological identification, the cell wall of the bacteria contains 14 to 17 branched fatty acids, different bacteria, and can be detected by gas chromatograph.\nMilitary collaborates can produce a variety of enzymes and toxins, including protease, phosphonic acid esterase, deoxyribonucleic acid enzyme, beta lactamase, and cytotoxin, which may be related to poison, nominal bacteria with two toxins, their structure and others Gram-negative bacilli is slightly different, free of hydroxy fatty acids, and 2-keto-3-deoxyic acid and special branched fatty acids, bacteria live in fresh water in natural environments, biofilm, can survive in distilled water 2 ~ 4 months, the river is 3 months in the water, around 1 year, the growth of the army collaborate can be supported by some free living protests, or in their body, such as Amiba, the protestocta and the army interaction, and The protrusions can change the virulence of the army.\n(2) pathogenesis\nThe damage to the human body (LP) can be divided into indirect damage and direct damage, indirect damage is starting from the role of alveoli macrophage (m\u03c6), and the study found that LP was swallowed in M\u03c6, Can suppress the fusion of phagocytic and lysosomes, and adjust the pH of mononuclear phagocytic cells to suit their survival and reproduction; LP capture m\u03c6 by interfering with the polarization of the interfering cells, successfully completing immunization, and using m\u03c6 The nutritional factors continue to survive, which in turn cracks M\u03c6, leading to acute damage to the epithelial epithelials and endothelials, and the hemama and fiber exudation, the military graft can also cause damage to the induction of apoptosis, and the direct damage of LP is mainly It is the effect of hemolyne, cytotoxins and enzymes, and the inhaled pathogenesis is phagocytized by macrophages, and has propagated in it, producing cytotoxins, killing macrophages, and invading other macrophages. The presence of antibodies does not prevent the propagation of the pathogen, while cell mediated immunity plays an important anti-infective action. The cytokine generated by the lymphocyte is stimulated by antigen can inhibit bacteria in macrophages, and then the antibody, complement and multi-core Some cells can eliminate pathogens, most patients have been limited to lungs, and there are many large leaf distributions, and small parts are focal or plaque distribution. The death of death is involved, and the upper leaves and the lower There is no significant difference in the chance of the leaf, and the lung tissue has congestion, edema and focus, often accompanied by small amount of celluloseine pleurisy, and microscopy is mainly cellulose suppurative pneumonia, and there is a large number of neutrophils in alveolar. At the same time, there is a large number of phagocytic cells.\nFibrin and medium amount of red blood cells and protein debris, some patients have acute diffuse alveolar damage, exhibiting transparent film formation, alveolar epithelial death, falling and regeneration, vascular endothelial cell swelling and denaturation, and small amount of inflammatory cells Incecretion, electron microscope observation of the hairy blood vessel and epithelial cell base film is still complete, prompting normal structure and function can be restored, the bronchi is often not obviously tired, so the patient's cough is not much, using improved Dieterle saturated silver, Jimsa staining, pathogenic bacteria It can be seen in phagocytic cells, neutrophils and extracellular, but non-specific, direct fluorescent antibody dyeing positive bacteria are specificity, abscess outside the chest, and the hot pathogenesis of Punda Ak is unknown. According to epidemiology and bacterial information, in the same construction unit is inhaled by aerosolic adhesive in the same construction unit, most people are infected, and the air conditioning system is contaminated with other bacteria pollution, the incubation period of this disease is 12 ~ 36h, this time is too short, it is difficult to use bacteria intrusion and propagation, which may be caused by a variety of bacterial toxins in water; or an immune response to a variety of microorganisms in water.",

    "cause": "1, Gram-negative bacillus\nIn the 1950s, Pneumococcus pneumococcus was the main pathogenesis (90%) of pneumonia, but with the advent of penicillin and some synthetic penicillin, the prevalence and harmfulness of the bacteria pneumonia was reduced, in nearly more than ten years Come, Gram-negative bacilli infection is significantly increased (82%), which is mostly E. coli, Krepen bacillus, Pseudomonascus, influenza, etc., although new antibiotics continue to come, there is still no change in this trend.\n2, respiratory conditions, pathogenic bacteria infections are gradually increased\nSince the body's resistance is lowered, the normal bacteria (fungi, anaerobic bacteria, etc.) of the mouth can cause pneumonia, and the perioblasts are 10-20 times, which is more than 10-20 times the needle. 1 / 3-1 / 2 is anaerobic infection, due to routine cultivation, it is easy to be neglected, so it should be cultivated frequently anhalaxy aerugin during the time of checking the test. Relevant health conditions, normal population pharyngeal Gram-negative bacilli only account for 2%, and the clinic patients account for 20%, and hospitalized patients increased to 30% -40%. The critically ill patients up to 75%, which may be to cause Gram-negative bacilli in the elderly. The main cause of pneumonia.\n3, mixed infection\nThe elderly often exhibit mixed infections caused by multiple pathogens, such as bacterial addavirus, bacteria, and anaerobic bacteria, such as bacterial addavirus, bacteria.\n4, drug resistance increase\nDue to the large number of antibiotics and widely used, the genes of pathogenic microorganisms have changed to produce resistance, with Gram-negative bacilli.",

laundry may exposure 2H; with 1% chlorinated lime and Ward (bleach) supernatant spraying, epidemic increase ventilation in public places, lactic acid, or chlorine-containing lime was sprayed fumigation.\n4, vaccine\nFlu vaccine can reduce the incidence of influenza, but because of the flu virus mutates constantly occur and affect vaccine effectiveness, when a small variation (antigenic drift) influenza virus subtype occur only within the same, there is a certain old vaccine strains cross immunity when effects, such as large variation subtypes (antigenic shift) occurs, the old vaccine strains without protection force, a pandemic caused by the emergence of a new subtype, you can use the new strain of working towards a vaccine to prevent pandemic second , three waves and a popular area has not yet occurred, the flu vaccine inactivated vaccine and live attenuated vaccine two kinds.\n(1) inactivated influenza vaccines: whole virus preparation is a monitoring influenza virus strains recommended trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, protection rate after subcutaneous injection of up to 80%, side effects, only 1% to 2% of vaccinated by fever and systemic reactions, about 25% of people vaccinated mild local reactions, such as with subunit vaccines, fewer side effects.\n\u2460 vaccination: mainly the elderly, infants, pregnant women, chronic heart and lung disease, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, after long-term use of immunosuppressive agents or salicylic acid preparations are taking, because these people are suffering from flu illness heavier, high mortality, but also may be complicated by Reye syndrome.\n\u2461 inoculation method: basic immunization should be vaccinated twice with an interval of 6 to 8 weeks, 1ml per adult, subcutaneous injection after subcutaneous injection of 1ml strengthen once, such as switching to a new subtype vaccine, the basis should be re-immunized every year.\n(2) live attenuated influenza vaccine: Selection of influenza virus is prepared Save live vaccine strain, inoculated caused mild upper respiratory tract infections in healthy human nasal cavity to produce immunity, inoculation can occur after 2 to 3 days mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and mild fever, lost 1 to 2 days, most of the observations prove that the preventive effect of inactivated vaccine similar.\n\u2460 vaccination: when new virus subtypes emerge, people lack immunity, were not prevalent in the area or population, in addition to a contraindication, shall conduct a comprehensive vaccination, when the small variation of the virus occurs only within the same subtype, vaccination mainly for medical staff, nurses, cooks, service workers and the seaport and transportation personnel and other key populations and spread of the disease closely related, priority should be immune to pupils in rural areas, for children 7 to 15 years of age or Planting large vaccination should be preceded 50 to 100, was observed after 4 days without serious reaction, and then expanded vaccination.\n\u2461 inoculation time: epidemic season should be based, is generally seeded before the epidemic season in 1 to 3 months.\n\u2462 inoculation method: each side of the nasal spray method 0.25ml.\n\u2463 contraindications: the elderly, pregnant women, infants and people with severe diabetes or chronic heart, lung and kidney disease in patients with allergies and fever.\n5, drug prevention\nSome drugs used to treat influenza can also be used to supplement way to prevent flu, as a vaccine immunization program, not the individual at high risk of influenza vaccination or take medication precautions during the entire flu season when flu outbreak, if you can get the vaccine , while it shall immunization, the drug can be stopped at 14 days after inoculation using the contrary, such as failure to inoculation, the drug should be taken continuously throughout the outbreak, medical personnel administering to a patient and taking these drugs help control iatrogenic infections, is also effective for post-exposure prophylaxis in the family, anti-influenza virus drugs currently applied in many countries as amantadine hydrochloride (adamantan), including amantadine and rimantadine, during the influenza epidemic, prophylactic administration of healthy adults or children amantadine or rimantadine for the prevention of influenza a viruses have 70% to 90% efficiency, after the onset of administration of the two drugs within 48h already infected, can also play a therapeutic role , reduce illness and shorten the course, although similar to the effectiveness of the two drugs, but rimantadine safer, particularly for kidney function in the elderly harm, but it is invalid for the prevention of influenza B, neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir) are another class of drugs that can be used to prevent influenza to prevent infection of the effective rate of 82%, it can be tested in healthy adults during an epidemic.",
    "cause": "Mainly caused by influenza viruses, influenza virus is divided by human influenza virus into A, B, Class A, A, A, A-type subtype, according to the different minutes of HA and Na antigenicity.\nImmunity is any foreign matter that human body's own defense is human identification and eliminating any foreign objects that deals with aging, damage, death, denatured self-cells and identify and treat mutant cells in vivo cells and viral infection.\n1. Hemaglin: HA is one of the glycoprotein protrusions of the influenza virus envelope, plays an important role in influenza virus infection and replication. 1 The surface of the host cell (including the red blood cell) has a hemagglin receptor. The influenza virus is combined with hemagglutinum, so that the flu virus is adsorbed to the host cell membrane, due to the adsorption of influenza virus to red blood cells, red blood cell agglutination phenomenon, blood gel Therefore, after this, the influenza virus is adsorbed to the host cell surface, and the fusion process of the viral envelope and the cell membrane is initiated, and the virus is realized to the host cell membrane, and then the cell is in the form of a vesicle in the form of a vesicle. 2 In the low pH environment in the vesicle, HA cleavage is HA-1 and HA-2 subunits, and the conformational changes are changed, and the fusion sequence present on the end of HA-2 is exposed, activated dissolved polypeptides, so that it has been The viral nuclear housing in the form of vesicles into the host cell is released.\n2, neuraminine enzyme (Na): Na is another kind of glycoprotein protrusion of the influenza virus envelope, but the number is significantly less hemagglutinant, which can lysis oligo polysaccharide and terminal neuramine residues (ie n- Binding bond between acetyl neurine, also known as a sachetic acid, the hemagglin receptor containing a siphonic acid coupled to oligomeric polysaccharide, a degradation of neuraminase on them? It has important viral biological significance:\n(1) Neucine enzyme damage to the sialic acid contained in the host cell surface receptor can cause the flu virus to be released from the infected cells, and release the influenza virus that releases the extracellular fluvosis to disperse each other, There is always conducive to its spread.\n(2) The respiratory mucus is also contained in the sacral acid ingredient, the gangluozyme has a cleavage activity, so that the flu virus breaks through the block of mucus, which is easy to spread in the respiratory mucosa.\nDue to the important role of neuraminase in the influenza virus replication, and the active site of the neuraminase is highly conserved in the A, B influenza virus, therefore, many new anti-influenza drugs in development Na as a target of the pharmaceutical effect.\n3, nuclear housing protein (RNP): a viral structure protein that cohesively constitutes a nuclear shell with viral RNA, including nuclear protein (NP) and three polymerase proteins (Pb-1, Pb-2, Pa), three polymerizations. The enzyme protein is synthesized in the host cytoplasmic, and then transferred to the nucleus, in the nucleus, the PB-1 is the highest homology, which is responsible for virus mRNA synthesis. After the extended extension, PB-2 is RNA polymerase depends on viral RNA, which functions to identify and bind to a cap structure transcribed by host cell polymerase II, can cut the cap structure from host cells and connected to viruses. On the 5th side of the specific mRNA, the cap structure is the primer of viral mRNA transcription, the transcription of the start RNA, during the transcriptional process, PB-2 may participate in the resection of mRNA 5 end cap structure, Pa in virus RNA The role in synthesis is not fully clarified, which may be a kinase or a hydrotreal protein.\n4, membrane protein (mA) is one of the structural components of the influenza virus envelope, including M1, M2, M1 containing 252 amino acids, and is the most abundant polypeptide in the viral body, which has a form of influenza virus. One of the main dependences, M1 may play an important role in sub-viral assembly, while protecting the ribonuclein particles, M2 is a complete membrane protein, containing 97 amino acids, only in the epiral influenza virus, M2 is in a large amount of tetramer formation in the surface of the trained host cell, while the content is small in the virus body, its function is a proton channel action, and the pH value in the gol base cavity in the HA synthesis, and the viral uncap process The acidification of the internal vesicle inside.\nPathogenesis\nInfluenza viruses can infect all kinds of cells of the respiratory tract, and can be replicated in it, the main mechanism of the disease is caused by viral replication, and the influenza virus enters and planted in the respiratory epithelium, and is carried out. And peg into the respiratory epithelial cells, and replicate in the cells, lasting 4 to 6 h, new viral particles from the cell membrane, release, re-infect adjacent epithelial cells, short-term respiratory tract Epithelial cells, necrotic, falling off, and local inflammatory responses, while causing systemic poisoning reactions such as fever, pain and leukocyte decrease, virus replication cytoplasm is the main principle of influenza disease, and excess interferon in circulation may Related to systemic symptoms, but no pathological changes in diseasemia, the pathological changes of simple flu are mainly due to upper damage in the respiratory tract, tracheal accumulation, cilia epithelial cell degeneration, necrosis and falling, cytoplasmic visible incident, mucosal congestion edema Nuclear cell infiltration, but the basal cell layer has no damage. After 4 to 5 days of the disease, the base layer has begun to proliferate, forming undifferentiated epithelial cells, and the formation of cilia is recovered after 2 weeks, and the pathological characteristics of influenza viral pneumonia are in the lungs Extensive bleeding, lungs are dark red with edema, tracheal, bronchial bleeding, mucosal congestion, tracheal, bronchiosis, mucosal cell necrosis, mucosa under mucosa, edema and mild inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar fibrin Original oozing, neutrophils and monocytes.",

The minimum contact amount and individual susceptibility have mainly role in the etiology. It is more stable, beryllium mine smelting, manufacturing beryllium alloy, can be hinged and hinged. Tablet dust or soot, its compound has an oxygen, hydroxide, fluoride, chloride, etc., mainly in the form of a breathing tract in the form of smoke or dust.\n(2) pathogenesis\nAcute beryllium poisoning is a high concentration of direct chemical toxicity stimuli of respiratory system, and is a poisoning of organism, which is characterized by respiratory inflammation and chemical pneumonia - based tissue morphology. Neritorial and necrosis of hepatocytes and necrosis of nephrosis and necrosis, acute beryllium poisoning has a dose reaction relationship.\nAlthough the pathogenesis of the chronic beryllium poisoning is still not fully clear, most scholars believe that it is a delayed cellular immune disease, and the binding of inside is bonded to the in vivo, and induces a non-ferrous resistant antibody, once again When exposed to beryllium (even if the exposure concentration of exposure) causes a beryllium antigen-antibody reaction, an inflammatory lesion is generated as a systemic disease in which pulmonite fibrosis and granuloma are formed as a major lesion, and its incubation can be several months or numbers Ten years, the patient's serum increases, the skin spots test, leukocyte movement inhibitory test and the original lymphocyte transformation test often have positive, glucocorticoids have obvious treatment effects on chronic beryllium poisoning. It is said that \u4e2d poisoning is a cellular immune disease.\nAcute beryllium poisoning: mainly pathological changes in acute chemical pneumonia, showing the increase in pulmonary volume, increased by green, tough, tough, microscope, lung, microscopy, vapor feeding, large amount of macrophage, cellulose and small amount Neutrophil, red blood cells and falling alveolar epithelium, lymphocytes, pulmonary cell infiltration, pulmonary tissue fibrosis can occur in the delayed case, in addition, liver substantive cells and renal tubule epithelials can occur in patients with severe cases Cell variability, necrosis.\nChronic beryllium poisoning: Pathological characteristics of chronic beryllium poisoning is non-cheese granuloma and mesulum cell infiltration in the lungs, eye view, lung volume, extensive dispensing of pulmonary surface and cutting (2 ~ 15mm), grayish white Nonjetary lesions, simultaneous visual interstitial fibrosis, microscopic, granuloma center is cellulose and epitheral cells, and the periphery is wrapped from fibrous tissue and some lymphocytes, slurry cells and monocytes infiltration, which often There are more Langcans giant cells, and there are various inclusive bodies, star-shaped, scallop-shaped, called star-shaped small or seashells, in He slice There is a blue black, about 6 to 60 \u03bcm size, and it is considered that it is that the camphorosis is adsorbed by protein and calcium salt, and the tissue form of chronic beryllium poisoning is quite similar to the nodular disease (Sarcoidosis), should be identified.\nIn addition, beryllium bud swelling can also occur at upper respiratory tract, liver, kidney, spleen, myocardium, horizontal muscle, pleura and skin, etc., is a manifestation of systemic beryllium poisoning.",

After birth, the child is flat, and the head is slightly raised, rare.",
    "cause": "Cause\nIt has not yet been fully understood, waiting to be studied, speculation is related to the following reasons:\n1. Cerebrovascular flow regulation function reduces normal neonatal cerebrovascular blood flow to adjust blood flow into brain tissue, when blood flow is reduced, cerebrovascular is diastolic, and when blood flow increases, the cerebral blood vessel shrinks, with this function Keeping the flow of the brain tissue is relatively stable, the blood pressure fluctuation is large, the blood flow changes is more, but the adjustment function of the cerebrovascular blood is reduced, when the blood pressure decreases, the blood flow is reduced, the cerebral blood vessel is not possible in time Droupless, formation of low perfusion of the brain, increased blood pressure, increased blood flow, the cerebral blood vessels have not been contracted in time, transform into high perfusion, the most prone to cerebral edema and intracranial hemorrhage during this transition, and low perfusion itself Can be used to expand oxygenous encephalopathy.\n2. The metabolism of abnormal human organs of brain tissue has the highest amount of oxygen and glucose in the brain, and the energy supply is inadequate during hypoxia ischemia. The metabolism affects brain tissue is also the largest.\n1 oxygen self-esteem (O2-) is damaged by a peroxidation reaction in the cell membrane, and the permeability of the capillary wall cell is increased, resulting in cerebral edema;\n2 Calcium ion channels on the cell membranes are open, and extracellular Ca ++ flows into the cell, destroying the survival of cells;\n3 brain in brain tissue increase, directly inhibit breathing, increase hypoxia;\n4 Metabolic and respiratory acid poisoning occurs when hypoxic ischemia, and the abnormal abnormalities of the above brain tissue can cause brain tissue to soften, necrotic, bleeding and forming a hole.\n3, brain to susceptible area for hypoxia ischemia\n1 Different germatitis has differently, the degree of susceptibility to hypoxia ischemia is also different, rich in cells, high vascular, high metabolic rate, high oxygen demivity, is the most sensitive to hypoxia ischemia, Premature infants' susceptible area under the ventricle pipe film, due to the most active cell metabolism at 28 \u00b1 weeks in the district, and the district capillaries lack support for connective tissue, easy to bleeding, to the premium 32-34 weeks The active cells of the post-born layer have gradually moved to the cerebral cortex, which is replaced by white matter, but because of the arterial endless area, the blood supply is insufficient, can still be affected by hypoxia ischemia, and the cerebral skin of the foot is active. The transfer of cells becomes a susceptible area;\n2 The arterial end tip of the artery is due to the low blood pressure, the blood pressure is low, and has become a good part of hypoxia ischemia. The top of the foot of the foot is in front of the brain, middle and post-mobilized end of the end, the most prone to disease, premature infants The white matter zone around the ventricle also is a arterial ending area, which is prone to organizational softening.\nPathological change\nAfter the hypoxia ischemia, edema, softening, bleeding, and necrotic death, and then form a hollow, underneath, beads, and epidural, the ventricle may shrink.\n1. The diseases of cerebral lesions are mostly in the cerebral cortex. In addition to edema, there is a bleeding and necrosis, forming a blast cavity, such as a spinene, said that a large cavity is called an empty brain (Porencephalen).\n2, the hemorrhagic part of the skull bleeding is mostly under the ventricular pipeline, and the full month is mostly in the brain, and the other, such as the epidural bleeding (SDH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in foot Month and premature infants can happen.\n3, brain dry lesions in the brain stem neurocal or white matter, the brain dry can also be contrast in the cerebral leather.\nThe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is caused by the suffocation of the full month. The more stolen, the longer, the cerebral disease is serious, the incidence of sequelae is also higher, the disease can also occur in premature infants, showing the softening of white matter around the ventricle (Periventricular Leukomalacia, PVLM).",

According to statistics, there are 50% to 60% of the cases to find obvious incentives, with 6% patients and even in bed.\n1. Primary pneumothorax is also known as a special pneumothorax, which refers to the pneumothorax of the health of the lungs. It has failed to find the pneumothorax of the health of the obvious lesion. The literature reported that this pneumothorax is the first place in spontaneous pneumothorax.\nThe cause of this disease and the pathological mechanism have not yet been clear. Most scholars believe that due to the crack of Bleb and pulmonary bulke (BULL), it is found according to the pathological histological examination of the pulmonary hazabopathological histopathological histopathological examination of idioptric plexus. In the case of a non-specific inflammatory scar under pleural, non-specific inflammation around the bronchi causes the elastic fibers and collagen fibers in the dirty pleural and pleural, which can reduce the elastic decrease in the adjacent alveolar wall, resulting in alveolar crackers. The pulmonary braceles were formed under pleuriscus, and non-specific inflammation of the tube itself plays a one-way live-action, thereby generating an epidalable germplasm to form a pulmonary hazab.\nSome scholars believe that the congenital development of lung tissue is not all the causes of pulmonary packed, that is, due to the poor development of the elastic fiber, the elasticity is low, the alveolar wall expands forms a large bubble, and Marfan syndrome (a common dyed Sexual genetic connective tissue is a typical example.\nIn the cause of this disease, some people put forward the \"new film theory\", side support disorder mechanism, atmospheric pollution, etc.\n2. Secondary pneumothorax is based on other lung diseases, forming pulmonary bulks or direct damage to pleura, often chronic obstructive emphysema or inflammatory fibrosis (such as silicone, chronic tuberculosis, Based on diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, cystic pulmonary fibrosis, etc. When it increases in cough, sneezing or intracellular pressure increases, 179 patients with spontaneous pneumothoraxia, which have caused pneumothorax, Wu's reports, chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary gemmoma account for the first place (38.5%). Secondly, the tuberculosis accounted for 17.3%, and the idioptic pneumothorax is 13.4% (3rd), golden staphylococcal pneumonia is 12.3% (4th), the rest is other reasons.\nPulmonics caused by S. aureus, anaerobic or Gram Negotic bacilli, etc. Pneumothorax, bronchial pulmonary vesicle rupture, etc. can be passed and passed, in addition, the esophagus or the like is inserted into the pleural cavity, and it can also cause pneumothorax to use glucocorticoids for a long time.\nAdvanced pneumothoraxes caused by certain diseases have been gradually noted by people in recent years:\n1 lung cancer, especially metastatic lung cancer, with the progress of comprehensive treatment, the survival period of patients with lung cancer is gradually extended, and the pneumothoraxing of lung cancer is increasing; the incidence is 4% of lung cancer (especially in advanced small cells) Lung cancer), the cause is: tumor blocking fine branch trachea, leading to limitant air and swelling; obstructive pneumonia further develops into pulmonary hydrazines, and finally breaks to the chest; the tumor itself is infringed or destroying the dirty pleura,\n2 nodular disease, mainly in the third stage, the incidence of pneumothorax is 2% to 4%, due to the post-fibrosis, resulting in the formation of pleuriscies or directly infringes the pleurum due to granulums.\n3 tissue cells increased x: According to reports, its spontaneous pneumothorax can reach 20% to 43%, which has obvious pulmonary fibrosis in advanced diseases, and finally leads to \"honeycomb\" and forming pulmonary bulks.\n4 Pulmonterioplasts (LAM): According to the literature, about 40% of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, Taylor reported 32 cases of LAM, 26 cases (81%) occurred in pneumothorax, this disease and estrogen change in vivo Closely relationship, due to partial or complete blocking muscle proliferation, causing pulmonary bulks, pulmonary vesicles, eventually resulting in a pneumothorax,\n5 AIDS: The incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax is 2% ~ 5%, Coker and other reports of the pneumothorax incidence of pneumothorax in the AIDS, the mechanism may be: the pathogenic violation of pleural lung tissue, and is easy to pass card Lung sac pneumonia, the latter has destructive effect on lung and pleuro, resulting in pneumothorax; direct cytotoxic effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on pulmonary hypertrophy cause elastic protease release, leading to emphysema, forming pulmonary large Blister.\n3. Special types of pneumothorax\n(1) Menstrual pneumothorax: The anti-pneumothorax of the menstrual cycle is first reported by Maurer in 1958, and in 1972, it was officially named the menstrual pleasure of menstruation by Lillington in 1972. The incidence of only women's spontaneous pneumothorax 0.9%, accounting for about 5.6% of female pneumothorax under the age of 50.\nThe cause is mainly related to the endometriosis of lung, pleura or intra-intiminaosis, and the exact pathogenesis has not yet, but people have proposed some theories to explain the mechanism of the disease:\n1 The endometriosis in the chest said that the reason is that the pneumothorax and the menstrual cycle are closely related; many cases have found endometrial ectopic in the chest; the right side of the disease and the endometriosis in the chest It is consistent; the age is also the same, due to the existence of endometriosis in the chest, and the endometrial lesion is congested during menstruation during menstruation, so that the lumen is partially blocked to form a \"live flap\" It causes excessive inflation of the distal limit to excessive thrust, but there is also a phenomenon that the endometriosis is not found to be about 75% of the endometriosis of the endometriosis due to this disease. Patients with endometriosis Frequent pleural effusion, menstrual hematopathizuck, but menstrual pneumothorax is not accompanied by hemoptysis and pleural effusion, so the menstrual pneumothorax caused by endometriosis only represents the cause of partial pneumothorax.\n2 diaphragmatic channel crack hole: From the embryonic development and anatomy physiology of diaphragm, gas from the abdominal cavity into the chest is: congenital defects of diaphragmous muscles, such as Morgagni holes and Bochdalek holes, etc. Cavity venous hole; congenital rupture of diaphragm, such as diaphragmus and uterine endometrium, forming a cracked hole, MeiS 'syndrome and tuberculous patients have confirmed that there is a path between the chest and abdomen, but there is no view in men. A spontaneous pneumothorant happened to a single cause of insaneness, and three spontaneous pneumothorax accompanying abdomen, and attempted to prove that there is traffic between the chest and abdomen by radioactivity imaging method, but the result is not supported. The information further confirmed that the female-specific pathogenesis, during the menstruation, due to uneven uterine contractions, the air may enhance the air into the uterine cavity, and then reached the abdominal cavity via the fallopian tube. At this time, the ectopic endometrial tissue of the closed diaphragmous muscles is detached. The diaphragmatic passage is temporarily open, and the gas is inhaled from the diaphragm cracked pore under the action of the chest negative pressure suction pump; instead of the mucusal plug, the cervix is \u200b\u200bblocked by the mucous plug, and the gas is entered into the chest, this theory can Explanation of many clinical signs of this disease, such as doing diagnostic artificial inerts can induce pneumothorax; as a tubal ligation or posterior pneumothorax can be cured after the uterus, however, there is a rare in the endometriosis and defect, only 19%, Many cases still have recurrence after surgery, and therefore there is still recurrence after surgery, so it cannot be a comprehensive and reasonable explanation of this theory.\n3Kovarik, etc., it is considered that the intimae tissue in the pelvic cavity may vary from the diaphragm or blood flow, lymph route to form a lesion under the pulmonary enhancement, and fall off in the menstrual period, causing the pneumatic gas leakage to generate a pneumothorax, Japanese scholar reported 1 The diaphragmus was not seen before the chest exploration, and the endometrial tissue was found around the broken pulmonary bulfer, and this theory was supported.\n4 Prostaglandin (mainly prostaglandin F2a) level increases with menstrual pneumothorax: prostaglandin can regulate the tulind function of pulmonary vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, Rossi believes that this disease is a patient's prostaglandin F2a in the blood during menstruation. Rising, The bronchial smooth muscle contraction, the pressure of the airway increase, which causes alveolar and pleura rupture to form a pneumothorax, and the prostaglandin F2a can cause endometrial necrosis, but there is currently a lack of adequate evidence.\n(2) Pregnancy-merged pneumothorax: Most of the fertility period, patients with this disease cause a pneumothorax for each pregnancy, depending on the time of pneumothorax, can be divided into early (3 to 5 months) and later (8 pregnancy) Both months, the mechanism is not very clear. Some people believe that the change in adrenal hormone levels and thoracotomy changes, the pneumothorax that occurs early in pregnancy, some scholars believe that the level of adrenal hormone is reduced (literature report patients) The 17-hydroxy sterol content in urine was 3.25 \u03bcmol / 24 h (1.18 mg / 24h), while the pregnancy was reduced to 2.77 mol / 24h (0.77 mg / 24h), but it also believed that the adrenal skin in the pregnancy, thereby inhibited Remediation after connective tissue injury, for spontaneous pneumothorax that occurred in the late pregnancy, may be related to the low compliance of thoracic cavity.\n(3) Spontaneous pneumatic breasts: 60 years old, spontaneous pneumothorax is called the spontaneous pneumothorax of the elderly, in recent years, the incidence of this disease has increased, many men are more than women, mostly in chronic lungs The disease (about 90%), which occupy the first place in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the mechanism is not very clear, but may be based on the original chronic lung disease, due to the elderly systemic tissue and organs constantly aging, alveoli The flexibility is reduced, the whole body resistance is reduced, in general activities, even cough, sneezing and screen, and the stool can cause alveolar cracking to cause the pneumothorax.\n(2) pathogenesis\nWith the development of science and technology, especially the further improvement and progress of optical technology and micro-camera systems and high-definition imaging systems, VATS (TV thoracoscopic technology) is widely used in clinical practice. The entire pulmonary surface lesions can be investigated, and the micro-pulmonary pleural lesions can be enlarged under high-definition endoscopy and television displays. Level 4: Level I is a special pneumothorax, endoscopic observation of lung tissue has no obvious abnormalities; II is a pneumothorax with a dirty layer, wall layer pleura adhesion; Class III is a dirty pleura bubble and diameter <2cm lung ; \u2163 \u53f7, there are multiple diameters> 2 cm of pulmonary bulks, this grading method has clinical practical value for guidance to choose reasonable treatment, such as the idioplastic chest, direct naked eye observation almost normal appearance, but appearing in new High-definition endoscopy and television displays enlarged observation of pulmonary blisters with 1 to 2 mm in diameter, can directly solidify the inner mirror laser or electric knife, or to induce pleural fixation, II still use laser Or directly solidified, or is closed with fibrin glue, but must decompose the adhesive belt during surgery, and the III can be directly solidified by pulmonary bulks in diameter <2 cm, but must be added with pleural fixation, grade IV. A giant pulmonary packer can withstand the opening of the chest surgery, and simple pulmonary bullenum extension or pulmonary wedrous removal can not be tolerated by the chest surgery, then sprayed into talc powder (or tetracyclines, etc.) Pleural fixation.\nSome scholars have made chest surgery and histiplica examination based on pulmonary orblicular pneumothorax, divide the pulmonary sputum into three types: type I: is a thin-walled cyst, which is almost uncommon with the bronchi, basically belonging to the nature of lungs, single The cavity, there is no smascity in the cavity, the diameter is generally counts, sometimes up to 15 ~ 25cm, it is obvious to the ordinary X-ray chest radiograph, forming a tension large bubble emphy, and the surgery is used to remove the large bubble, the treatment effect is best. , Type II: The large bubble is medium diameter, fibrosis thick-walled, located in the deep lung quality, belongs to the lungs, the large bubble is separated by many intervals, and only the surface part of the leuki, one can be seen in the lungs II type pulse bulss, patients may have no symptoms, and X-ray chest phleti can also be free, but the spontaneous pneumothorax is caused by spontaneous pneumatic breasts, and the rupture of the bubble is generally peeping under the thoracoscope, III: is big Lung sputum, and not only exist in a pulmonary leaf, there is a plurality of beams in the bubble, and is widely used with bronchial transport. The type is the most common cause of diffuse propulsion emphysema. Once crack, the spontaneous pneumon is formed. The incidence and mortality rate are high.\nIn 1980, OHATA and other reports, 334 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, a row of chest surgery, 126 cases of histological optical microscopy, and 60 cases of pulmonary gas and swelling bubbles were divided into three types on the basis of scanning electron microscopy: Reid type I, ReiDIT type and huge pulmonary pneumless, Reid type I feature is that the excessive expansion of lung tissue forms a large bubble, the neck stenosis is clear and the entire lung structure is clear; the pleura thin, the surface is skin The cells are sparse, some areas are even completely lacking, and the collagen fibers are exposed to the outside, and they can see the small holes or cracks of micrometers. The large bubble is flat, consisting of amorphous materials, scattered in a small circular Hole, while observing the small hole with a microscope during surgery, the electron microscope examination found that there is completely lack of mesothelial cells around the small holes, there is no cell substance in the inner surface of the large bubble, but the wave collagen fiber bundle, the ReidII is characterized by the pulmonary Bear is shallow; the neck is wider, and the dividing between the entire lung tissue is unclear, and the electron microscopy shows the relatively completeness of the pleural surface of the large bubble portion, and the short micro-velvet is still covered. Like the REID type I large bubble, deteriorated alveolar exposure to the cavity of the large bubble; the alveolar structure is relatively normal, and can be seen in the Cohn hole, the massive large bubble volume is large, occupying 1/3 of the single chest, large bubble The wall is thin and translucent, the electron microscope checks the surface of the large, and has a normal size of meteothelial cells and thick and short microroate and normal alveolar structures. Therefore, according to the pneumothorax pathology, it is further clarified that its pathogenesis is further clarified. The formation of spontaneous pneumothoraxes is not necessary to break with large bubbles, but may be due to pneumatic or complete lack of pleural mesothelial cells (such as REID Type I), the air is high in the lungs, air passes through the large bubble wall The cleft holes entered the pleural chamber, and it is important to play an important role in spontaneous pneumothorax occurrence.",

Strengthen quarantine, prevent avian influenza viruses, especially highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infections, to my country. In particular, it should be noted to strengthen epidemic prevention disinfection of transportation tools from animal epidemic countries or regions, prohibiting passengers from carrying or mailing related animals and their products. Adhere to the full-feeding method of the poultry, usually strengthen disinfection, improve the immunity of general diseases, and improve the resistance of birds. Once the avian influenza epidemics are found, it must be treated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Animal Quarantine Law. Early quick diagnosis, if found and diagnosed as a highly pathogenic strain such as H5, H7 type, strict isolation, blocking, culling, destroying, cleaning, cleaning, cleaning, cleaning, and thorough disinfection. The current taken is a chicken group in all chicken farms in a 3km range in the sources of fungus, and mandatory immunization of chickens in 5km. Farm and all relevant personnel do a good job in protecting and strengthen monitoring. When there is an influenza symptom in such person, it is immediately isolated and reported, and epidemiological investigation is performed to prevent the disease and the expansion of the epidemic. While isolating patients, the patient's nose, pharynx, mouthwash, sputum or tracheal absorbers and serum are collected to the designated laboratory, and viral isolation and antibody detection will be used to clearly diagnose as soon as possible.\n2 cut-off transmission channels\nOnce people avian influenza epidemics, the poultry farms, commercially available birds, slaughterhouses, and patients are completely disinfected, and the family should be destroyed or buried against dead poultry and poultry waste; the hospital's clinic and ward of patients Do a good job in disinfection, prevent the patient's excrement and blood pollution in the environment and medical supplies; medical staff should do personal protection, contact avian influenza should wear a mask, wear gloves, wear isolated clothes, should be washed back. Strengthening the management of specimens and laboratory avian influenza virus strains, laboratories for the separation of avian influenza virus should reach the P3 level standard. Strictly implement the operating specifications to prevent hospital infections and laboratory infections and spread.\n3 advocate healthy lifestyle\nUsually strengthen physical exercise, avoid excessive fatigue, pay attention to nutrition. Do not smoke, wash hands, pay attention to diet hygiene, do not drink water. When discovers the epidemic, people should try to avoid contact with birds, and foods such as chicken should be completely cooked, not eating or semi-cooked animal food, keeping indoor air fresh circulation. For close contacts, it can be prevented by oral anti-influenza drug such as octal amine, Ossemei et al.\n4 vaccine\nCurrent H1N1, H3N2 and the flu vaccine cannot prevent H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2 viral infections.

Many farms in China are hanging on a giant net on the farm of the poultry to prevent the virus from infecting poultry.\nIn poultry, the goose is infected, and the disease resistance is relatively high, and the living opportunities after the disease are also very high. However, the chicken is very sensitive to the influenza virus. Once infected, it is not only spread quickly, and the chicken with a disease will soon die.

As an aging country, my country has been an aging, the number of patients with IPF is also increased year by year, and the conservative estimate is at least 500,000. As a chronic mesenchymal lung disease, IPF is hidden, the condition is gradually increased, and it can also be expressed as an acute aggravation. The average survival period after IPF diagnosis is only 2.8 years, and the mortality is higher than that of most tumors, IPF is called a \"tumor disease\".\nAccording to the US Brasurgic Association / European Respiratory Society, the International Multi-discipline classification of idioptic pneumonia (IIPS), IIPS is divided into major IIPS, rare IIPS and unable to classify IIPS. The main IIPs have 6 types, including IPF, idiopathic non-specific mesopic pneumonia (INSIP), respiratory fine bronchitis with azogeneous pulmonary disease (RB-ILD), delatable interstitial pneumonia (DIP ), Homogenous mechanized pneumonia (COP), acute ampioxinitis (AIP). Less IIPs have two types, including idiopathic lymphocyte-like pneumonia (ILIP), idioptic pleural pulmonary substance elastic fiber hyperplasia (IPPFE). IPF is the most common type in primary aged pneumonia.",

Patients should be encouraged to participate in lung rehabilitation exercise, such as walking every day, stepping on fixed bicycles, etc.",
    "cause": "Early PF may produce an anti-specific immune response, and the inflammatory response of the lower respiratory tract is the first impaired damage, macrocytes, macrophages, and neutral granulocytes in messenger and alveolar, T lymphocytes in IPF. Dual role in the regulation of lung injury and disease progression, from the T lymphocytes obtained from the IPF patient alveolar, which can express the IL-2 receptor and secretion of INF-\u03b3, T lymphocyte secretion can be inhibited into fibers The proliferation of cells can also enhance collagen synthesis of fibroblasts. In addition, T lymphocytes also have huge auxiliary effects on B lymphocytes, which is important to enhance immune complexes.\nThe production of lung substantial inductive immune responses is important for the aggregation of inflammatory cells affecting lung tissue, selective adhesion molecules, adhesion molecular weighting and immunoglobulin plays an important role in the interaction of inflammatory cells and endothelial cells. Many cells are firmly adhered to adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and leukocyte antigens - 1 (LFA-1), TNF-\u03b1 in induced ICAM-1 expression, and white blood cells outside the blood vessels LFA-1 and platelet endocyte adheres are expressed in white blood cells and endothelial cells, and urokinase type plasminogen activator (urokin U-PA) may be inflammatory cells from blood vessels to alveolar cavity. The degradation of proteolytic enzymes of the tissue, IPF's inflammatory cells directly migrated on a variety of chemicals, chemokines include interleukin-1 (IL-1) monocytes chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophages Inflammatory protein-Ia (MIP-1A), complement ingredient C5a, cytokine (MCP-1, MIP-1A, fibrous ligand comprising RGD acting on macrophages, white triangle B4 (LTB4), IL-8 and effects In white blood cells C5A, T lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts are important sources of these cytokines, and urokinase receptors (U-PAR, CD87) are required for monocytes and PMNs. The chemokine, U-PAR may affect the expression of the white blood cell cycle and activate the adhesion of the complement receptor 3.\nEpithelial cell injury is a symbol of IPF, viral infection and inflammatory cell product (oxygen free radical, proteolytic enzyme) is a damaged intermediary substance, epithelial cell damage to exude plasma proteins into the alveolar cavity, during injury, alveolar layer It can be destroyed, the presence of an activated inflammatory cell (lymphocyte, macrophages, PMN) sustains the development of the alveolar wall damage.\nThe successful repair of damage to the alveolar requires the removal of plasma protein into the pulmonary cavity, replacing the damaged alveolar wall, re-storeing the extracellular matrix of damage, the alveolar exudate formed during the inflammatory reaction includes many cytokines and media such as growth factor (platelet growth Factor, transfer growth factor-\u03b2, insulin-like growth factor -i), fiber-linked, thromboin, fiber peptide, etc., alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages regulate the formation and removal of cellulose in alveolar, due to \u03bc-PA presence However, there is a melodel protein degradation activity in the alveolar cavity, however, fibrin degradation activity in IPF patient BAL is due to plasminogen activator and plasminogen such as plasminogen activation inhibitors - 1 (PAI-1) The level of level is increased, and similarly, the fiber linked in the alveolar cavity is also inhibited. If the oozing liquid in the alveolar is not removed, fibroblasts will invade, proliferate, produce new matrix proteins, make it rich in fiber The oozing liquid becomes a scar.\nPeanuts also plays an important role in the fibrosis of IPF, intermediarin has a direct effect on fibroblasts and other interstitial cells, stimulating fibroblast release chemokines, promoting cell proliferation and collagen synthesis, alveolar repair An important feature of the epithelial restructuring of the alveolar substrate, in order to accomplish this process, type II pulley epithelial cell hyperplasia, final base film surface repair, local exudate, this process is undoubtedly in keratinocyte growth factor Under the influence of hepatocyte growth factor, these two factors regulate the proliferation and movement of epithelial cells.\nDuring the formation of IPF, epithelial cells were missing, alveolar collapse, and formed agglomerated scars when tired and a large amount of alveolar.\nPathogenesis\nTissues of lung biopsy specimens are important to exclude other diagnosis and fibrosis and inflammation levels. The main pathological features of IPF include alveolar interval (interstitial) and different degrees of fibrosis and inflammation of alveolar because many inflammatoryity Pulmonary disease can be similar, so it must be excluded from granuloma, vascular, inorganic lung calm disease or organic lungs, and pathological changes in IPF are varied, and are distributed in a sheet, and more in the lungs. Under pleural, even in severe lesions, some alveoli can also be avoided, in the early days, the alveolar structure can be kept intact, but the edema of alveolar wall is thickened, and the internal inflammatory cells are aggregated, and monocytes are mainly Such as lymphocytes, slurry cells, monocytes, macrophages, but also visible polynuclear neutrophils and eosinophils.\nIn the early stage of the disease, the alveolar macrophages in which alveolar macrophages were concentrated, moderate or progress period IPF, such as the progression of the disease, the increasing creature of chronic inflammation was more inconsistent, the alveolar structure was dense fibrous tissue Instead, the alveolar wall is broken, resulting in airway cystic expansion (honeycomb), late disease, a large amount of pulmonary collagen, intracellular matrix, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, large amounts of cells, inflammatory cells, It can be seen that alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, squamous born, some patients can occur in smooth muscle reactive hyperplasia, pulmonary stasis, secondary pulmonary hypertension, etc. The patient can be seen that the emphysema changes can be distinguished from the presence of fibrous tissue around the honeycomb chamber.\nDiffuse alveolar damage is not the characteristics of early IPF, or may be seen in many other lung diseases, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), inhalation lung injury, radioactive lung injury, pharmaceutical lung injury, collagen angiogenesis, infection, etc.\nI used to subjectively divide IPF into several pathogeneous, and considered de-scavenger pneumonia (DIP) and ordinary interstitial pneumonia (UIP) were pathological types of IPF different pathoines, and according to the American Bras Science Association (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) put forward a new international consensus on IPF: the UIP is attributed to the specific pathological manifestation of IPF, while DIP, respiratory bronchitis (RBILD), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), lymphocyteral metric pneumonia (LIP), acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), close-up fine bronchitis with aircraft pneumonia (BOOP) is not IPF.",

    "cause": "Exogenous allergic alveolar inflammation causes much, commonly used organic dust-containing dust-containing and fungal spores, animal and plant proteins, bacteria and their products, insect antigen and certain chemicals, etc. Organic dust, some dusty antigen properties have not yet been clear It is generally believed that the cause of peasant lungs is mainly ordinary high-temperature amplifier bacteria. In recent years, domestic scholars have reported another hot water absorbing stream of high temperature amplifier related to farmers, in many antigens, in many antigens The most common and important, especially the microsporidium, followed by a normal high temperature, and the bacteria have a fungi, but it belongs to the bacteria, in a humid, warm, moldy organic matter, compost, soil, Food and contaminated water contain a large number of bacteria, farmers inhalation of moldy hay, cereals and cane, etc. The bacteria is main, growing people can lead to mushroom workers, poultry breeders, poultry, feeding parcels, etc.) are caused by bird serum, bird feces, bird feathers, etc. Some people think that the cream on the pigeon feathers is a keratin particle antigen of about 1 \u03bcm. The disease is more important than the pigeon serum and excrement, and there is another domestic reported silkwormworm in the air. Dust (may be silk glue) causes allergic alveolar inflammation, humidifier, and air conditioner lung lungs are white thermophilica. After inhalation, its semi-antigen can also cause allergic alveolar inflammation, about tobacco growers, tea growers, etc., its antigen nature is not fully understood.\nIn recent years, exogenous allergic alveolar inflammation has been considered immunochronous diseases, and III-type metamorphosis is an important mechanism, and it is also related to IV metamorphosis, and the complement system has its significance, while activated alveolar macrophages may be onset. The central link of the mechanism.\n(1) The complement-mediated III metamorphosis reaction is insecting to be inactive after 4 to 8 hours after the sensitization of the individual, and ArtHUS reactions can occur 4 to 6 hours after intradermal antigen, and IgG is found in the skin specimen in the reaction site. And complement of the precipitate, most patient serum can find the precipitation antibody (IgG) of the corresponding antigen, which can develop the same pulmonary function as clinical exogenous allergic alveolitis, so this disease and complement The immune complex is of great significance to mediate the III-type metamorphosis reaction.\n(2) T lymphocyte mediated IV metamorphosis reactions in recent years, IV-type metamorphosis reactions play an important role in the incidence of this disease, patients with probiotics in patients with cheese granuuloma, lymphocytes encounter corresponding antigen in vitro It can produce macrophage movement inhibitory factor (MIF), animal experiments found that the sensitization T lymphocyte is implanted into the experimental animal, and the antigen is inhaled, which causes lung injury to human exogenous allergic alveolar inflammation. In the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid in patients with exogenous allergic alveolitis, the lymph factor increases, and the above findings support IV metamorphosis reaction in the pathogenesis of this disease.\n(3) The role of local macrophages can directly stimulate the alveolar macrophages and the release of proteolytic enzyme release, lysis C3b, and the latter is bonded to the complement receptor of the latter and the surface of the macrophage surface. Further activation of macrophages, which will continue to produce lung tissue lesions including granuloma formation.\nAt present, exogenous allergic alveolar inflammation is initially mediated by Type III metamorphosis, and then turning to IV allergic reactions, while macrophage activation and the resulting inflammatory response can also pass non-immunized pathways. It causes lung damage, but many details are unclear.",

The incidence of tuberculosis in clinical proof is closely related to the health of children and living environment. Pay attention to reasonable nutritional hygiene habits and prevention of measles.\n2. Discover cases and early prevention\nEarly detection is a prerequisite for early treatment. Regular physical examination with early detection of diseases in patients with disease-contacting patients, the incidence rate and the prevalence rate were more remarkable. In the high proliferation of children with 6.5%, the prevalence of collective children in the same period was 0.15%. In accordance with the average of 13 years of follow-up, the accumulated prevalence rate is 6%. Therefore, it is an important way to find tuberculosis by contact with non-tabular infection or disease is an important way to find tuberculosis. Secondly, in children who have strong positive positive, pay special attention to early discovery work, although tuberculosis is a chronic and extremely stubborn infectious disease, but if it can be seriously recovered, it is completely recovered.\n3. Mission, pay attention to isolation\nCarry out the work of extensive health education, so that the masses have the correct understanding of tuberculosis and make sanitary isolation and isolation work. Protect the children to make it unreamant. Collective institutions, such as the nursery children's kindergartens and primary schools and teachers should check with non-tuberculosis, once they find that active patients should leave jobs, and completely actively treat. In the family, hiring nanny or hiring teachers should first carry out the chest X-ray perspective to ensure non-tuberculosis.

Promote the maturity of premature premature plasheung, and can also have the same results for other heterogeneous animals. It will gradually apply to pregnant women, promote the maturity of premature infants, the most common hormones are Betame-Thaason and dexamethasone ( DEXAMETHASONE) Because other ACHs are easy to enter the fetus through the placenta, the ACH acts in stimulating the fetal lung type II cells to produce phospholipids and small molecular proteins, reduce the permeability of pulmonary capillaries, reduce pulmonary edema, so it can reduce the occurrence of RDS The rate, even if it is onset, the symptoms are also lighter, can reduce the mortality rate, the oxygen concentration in the treatment is too high, prevent bronchial lung development (BPD) and crystal fiber probant (ROP) and other complications, due to defective Oxygen, according to the treatment of neonatal necrotic intestine colitis and hypoxic ischemic intracranial hemorrhage.\nThe prevention dose of the pregnant woman ACH; double his rice, dexamethasone is 24mg, divided into 2 intramuscular injection, 24 hours interval, the domestic common dose is 5 ~ 10mg, my muscle injection or intravenous drops, once a day, 3 days Prevention should be given 7 days to 24 hours before delivery of pregnant women, so that the drug has sufficient time, ACH prevents the possibility of pregnant women and fetus without increasing infection, even if the amniocente is not in the original foundation Up to increase the infection rate, the delay in the uterus is not contraindication, and the extremely low birth weight of the delivery is not consistent with the effect of the RDS, which is generally considered to reduce the incidence of RDS, but in the survived baby. The incidence of bleeding from the lower hair layer can be reduced, and the ACH is poor in children with diabetic pregnant women and children with rh hemolymia and multiple children.\nAlthough ACH prevention is affirmed, there is still 10% of pregnant women's premature infants, so considering the addition of other hormones and rehautes the efficacy, thyroxine has the role of promoting lung maturation, but because it is not easy to pass the placenta barrier, it is unable to apply. Later, the structural function of thyroid release hormone in animal brain tissue was similar to the thyroxine, and the placenta can be used in the placenta, which is 0.4mg each time, 1 hour every 8 hours, 4 times, a total of 4 times, Some pregnant women may appear side effects, showing VA heart, vomiting and high blood pressure, can be reduced to a half amount, and after TRH, the incidence of RDS is reduced.\nSecond, postpartum prevention\nIt is pointed out the birth of the baby's lung surface activity and substance to prevent the occurrence or mitigation of RDS in half an hour. It is used to prevent the prevention of pregnancy. The more early effect is better, it is best to start before the baby's breathing begins or Before the start of the ventilator, it is dripped from the tracheal intubation, and the PS can be evenly distributed in the lungs, and the effect of preventing the effect of the RDS is lowered, and the patient's condition is lighter, because PS can be early Improve the oxygenation function (OXYgenation), some babies can do not have a ventilator, the supplied oxygen concentration and the average airway pressure can be lower, so the incidence of air leakage and oxygen poisoning has decreased significantly, and oxygenchemic cranial In the occurrence of internal bleeding, chronic lung disease (CLD) is more rare, and the CLD system requires an oxygen disease in 28 days, although there are many advantages, but the premature infants and suffocation do not have RDS. Infant infants who do not have problems will increase their costs and unnecessary tracheal intubation, and suffocation and premature infants often need more urgent recovery, and the PS prevention will temporarily interrupt the continuous process of recovery, so the campaign is the \"28 weeks\" Or premature baby in birth weight, such as the prevention of ACH prevention, the prevention of experience and skilled resuscites, other infants immediately use ventilator and trachea The pipe is dropped into PS and treated according to treatment.\nPS prevention and PS treatment is not easy to separate, many newborns after the recovery have irregular or distress, need PS to continue treatment, prevention and treatment amount, such as natural PS (regardless of pork lung or bovine PS) 100 ~ 150mg / kg, such as using the synthetic EXOSURF drop dose of 5 ml / kg (containing DPPC 67mg / kg). Refer to the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome and the third chapter of the third chapter of the cell active substance and its clinical application Overview.\nThird, joint prevention\nIt is estimated that pregnant women use ACH, and the postpartum is used for newborns using PS, which is used for 1 pre-prevention start. The pregnant woman has been delivered for 24 hours. Also often serious, this combined prevention is based, animal experiments have proved joint prevention than alone.",

As the premium of the gestational age, the synthesis of the PS is gradually increased, so the baby is more premature The less the amount of the PS, the higher the incidence of RDS, the more hormone in the pre-procurement of lung maturation, at this time, at this time, 32 to 34 weeks, after 32 to 34 weeks. The impact of the lung maturity is not very important. After 35 weeks, the PS is rapidly enters the surface of the alveolar surface. After birth, the lungs continue to develop, and the PS generated within 72-96 hours after birth is generally able to maintain normal breathing, so as long as it is PS lack stage is added, making premature bastions through difficulties, and survival can be improved.\nThe blood sugar of diabetic pregnant women is high, and the blood sugar of the fetus also increases. At this time, the secretion of fetal insulin must be increased to adapt to the needs of sugar metabolism, so that glucose is converted into a glycogen. In this case, the fetus has a huge obesity, but The lungs are not necessarily mature, and the insulin has the effect of antagonizing the adrenal hormones, affecting the development of the lung.\nThe embarrassment of the palace occurs in the fetus of the placenta. Due to the long-term hypoxia, the development of the fetal lung is low, and the PS secretion is low; and the suffocation is mostly caused by the cause of RDS in the newborns.\nThe size of the lungs is normal. Since the height is full of blood, it is dark red, and the quality H is sinking underwater. The cut surface is widely absorbed in the dark red lung tissue Sumui red mirror, and the alveolar wall is close to each other. There is only a small amount of expanded alveolar in the lungs, and the wall attached to a layer of embossed is uniform and structurally, that is, a transparent film, sometimes visible to the transparent film is free in alveolar, the alveolar tube and the fine trachea are expanded, and the wall is also With a transparent film, the pulmonary tissue has edema, sometimes visible to the process of concentrating into a transparent film, and can be seen from the large single core and multicore cells, survive 32 hours, often concurrent pneumonia, and the transparent film has been absorbed Or is loose granular fragments.\nPathogenesis\nThe PS can reduce the surface tension of the alveolar wall and the alveolar gases, so that the alveolar is opened, and the half-life is short and needs to be constantly supplemented. When the PS is deficient, the tension of the alveolar surface increases, the alveolar plug, so that the energy loss, lungs The curve is moved down, the compliance decreases, the invalid cavity, the breathing work is significantly increased, the energy is exhausted, resulting in full body dirt failure, according to formulas:\nP (alveolar retardation ratio) = 2T (surface tension) / R (alveolar radii).\nThe minimum radius is the first to get the first pulmonary, so that the number of alveolarous alveolar and ventilation of immature pulmonary pulmonary, the alveolar is wide, and the gas dispersion and exchange are severe, the end of the alveolar drop Difficult ventilation, hypoxemia appears, the ability of alveolar epithelial cell synthesis of surface active material, resulting in clinical respiratory difficulties and hair control, continuous hypoxia, cause pulmonary vessel, low pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary blood flow reduction Lap-to-left distraction, pulmonary intravenous diversion, loss of ventilation-perfusion, affecting qi and blood exchange, continuous hypoxia and acidosis can cause myocardial damage, heart output, systemic low blood pressure, low perfusion, Finally, a multi-organ failure mainly based on respiratory failure is as follows: the active substance of alveolar surface is insufficient \u2192 the surface of the alveolar wall is increased (an increase in alveolar retransmission) \u2192 The minimum alveolar of the radius is the first to add \u2192 conductive lungs. \u2192 Oxygen, acidosis \u2192 pulmonary arteriosclerosis \u2192 pulmonary pressure increase \u2192 Oval hole and arterial catheter open \u2192 Right left shunt (continuous fetal circulation) \u2192 lung irrigation flow drop \u2192 lung tissue hypoxia heavier \u2192 capillary permeability Adding \u2192 fibrin sinking \u2192 transparent film formation \u2192 hypoxia, acidosis is more serious, causing a malignant cycle.\nDue to the decrease in the secretion of the pulmonary PS, the blockage of the PS recirculating pathway, or due to excessive liquid in the pulmonary cavity (transport disorder, high oozing), a large amount of plasma protein is contained, and the pathological exudation fluid contains a large amount of plasma protein. In the alveolar cavity interference and inhibit PS function, the birth situation of inhalation, pneumonia, pulmonary development, pulmonary bleeding, pulmonary hemorrhage, and asphyxia hypoxia damage can be related to the above pathological physiology, premature influous pulmonary surface activity The total amount of phospholipids of the substance, only 10% to 30%, or less, and lack of the major pulmonary surfactant proteins such as SP-A, B, and C. It is the main reason for RDSN. It is used to apply exogenous pulmonary surface active material preparations. It can rapidly increase the content of lung surface in the lungs, and the lung surface active material is dropped into RDSN, and the lung surface activity is added to the lungs of RDSN. Substance phospholipids are immediately uptaked by alveolar epithelial cells, and gradually strengthen the functional activity of endogenous pulmonary surface active substances, in particular to promote SP-A, B, C synthesis secretion, this process and clinical reactions after administration and transfer closely related.",

Second is strictly sterile operation technology and disinfection isolation, strictly control the wound-lung-wound bacterial cross-infection; regular elevation secretionTablet and culture, use sensitive antibiotics, and should be strengthened to improve the body's immune function, which is necessary to prevent infection.",
    "cause": "The reasons for inhalation injury is mainly thermal, but at the same time, a large amount of smoke, carbon particles, stimulating chemicals, etc., etc., also damage the respiratory tract and alveoli. Therefore, inhalation injury is a mixed damage of thermal and chemicals.\nInhalation damage is related to the injuries. It is often happening in an unopened or sealed environment, especially when exploding, in this environment, the environment is large, high temperature, not easy to spread, patients can not immediately leave the fire; plus in a closed space, combustion is incomplete, generated A large amount of carbon monoxide and other toxic gases, causing patients to poison and coma, and suffering from suffocation. When combining the explosion, high temperature, high pressure, high flow rate airflow and strong toxic gases can cause damage to the deep and lung substance of the respiratory tract. In addition, the patient stands or runs away, causing heat inhalation, and is one of the causes of injury.\n1. Direct injury of heat on respiratory tract\nThermally includes two kinds of dry heat and heat. Flames and hot air belong to dry heat, and thermal vapor belongs to wet heat. When the hot air is incorporated, the acoustic band is reflectively closed, and the heat transfer capacity of dry heat air is poor, the upper respiratory tract has a water heat exchange function, absorbs a large amount of heat to cool it; dry hot air reaches the branched branch At the time, the temperature can drop to the original 1/5 ~ 1/10. Therefore, dry heat tends to cause upper respiratory trays. Wet heat air is about 2000 times more heat capacity of dry hot air, and the conduction capacity is about 4,000 times the air is about 4000 times, and the heat is slow, so the wet heat is removed from the upper respiratory damage and the tracheal damage, and the bronchial and lung substance is also damaged.\n2, harmful substances to respond to respiratory tract\nIn addition to the granules inhalation of the smoke, there are a large amount of hazardous substances, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, peroxide, hydrochloric acid, cyanhydrate, aldehyde, ketone, and the like. These substances can cause direct damage to the respiratory tract by thermal action. Toxic gases can stimulate laryngeal and bronchospasm and have chemically damaged respiratory tract. Water-soluble substances such as ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, etc. are acid or alkali, which can cause chemical burn. Nitride can react with water, salt, and generate nitric acid and nitrite, directly corroded the respiratory tract, and the latter is bonded to hemoglobin, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Cyrr hydrogen can cause cytochrome oxidase to lose oxygen action and inhibit intracellular breathing. The aldehyde can reduce cilia activity, reduce alveolar macrophage viability, and damage the capillaries and cause the pulmonary edema. The acrolein content in the smoke produced by the polyurethane combustion is about 50 ppm, and chemical respiratory damage and pulmonary edema can occur in the suction of 5.5 ppm, and 10 ppm can cause death within a few minutes. The toxicity of cyanide and carbon monoxide is added, and when the temperature is increased to 1000 \u00b0 C, the polyurethane foam is decomposed to produce a large amount of hydrogen cyanide, and people can die when the cyanide concentration is 100 \u03bcmol / L during serum.\nAfter the carbon monoxide in the smoke is inhaled, the carbon monoxide poisoning will lead to personnel, and the weight can die on the spot. When the air containing 5% carbon monoxide is suction, poisoning can be caused.\nHis toxicity is:\n(1) Carbon monoxide is combined with hemoglobin to form carbozemic protein, and the dissociation of carbon oxygen hemoglobin is equivalent to 1/3600 of the ionomoglobin dissociation rate, and carbon monoxide is more than 200 to 300 times the affinity of carbon monoxide and blood play protein. Therefore, blood band oxygen dysfunction is caused to cause systemic tissue hypoxia.\n(2) Reduce the ability of cell enzyme systems to utilize oxygen. Carbon monoxide and oxygen competition cytochrome oxidase system, directly inhibits cell breathing.\n(3) Carbon monoxide is bonded to myoglobin, reducing the delivery of oxygen in tissue.\nIn addition, when the fire, high concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide can increase the symptoms of carbon monoxide, and aggravate tissue hypoxia.",

    "prevent": "Pay attention to rest\nThe smaller the baby, the more rest and care, and then resume the event after the illness disappear to avoid recurrence due to failure of the lesion. There is a fever baby, it is best to rest in bed to reduce the stimulation of the neural system.\n2. Reasonable diet\nThe feverful baby is easy to lose, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Dietary care is very important, the overall principle is to choose easy-to-digest food, eat less meals. If you strive to eat your baby, you will cause the baby's gastrointestinal burden and harmful to physical and disease recovery. Every time you eat, you will be less, you can eat more times, give your baby some fruit juice, such as fresh orange juice. Baby diet can be figher after heating and digestive ability. With the improvement of your baby's condition, it is generally recovered to weekday diet.\n3. Environment is suitable\nKeep your baby's room air circulation. For fever baby, fresh air helps skin effectively sweating and reduce body temperature. It should be avoided directly to your baby, but causes baby skin vascular contraction and aggravating the condition.\nArrange a good rest environment for your baby, stay quiet, don't talk, don't increase your baby's sleep time to reduce energy consumption. You can let your baby lay on the bed, whispering the baby whispers or listening to music, helping the baby relax, will play the effect of promoting the rehabilitation of the disease.\n4. Effective sweating\nEncourage the baby to drink more water. Water can increase body cell metabolism, promote the discharge of toxins in vivo, and can effectively sweat, which is conducive to reducing body temperature.\nThe baby's clothes and bedding should not be too thick, wearing loose trousers, with great sweating and heat dissipation. Don't pass the hot baby through the multi-clothes and covers the thickness, otherwise it will easily lead to high heat, and even induce high fever! After taking antipyretics, it will sweat in a lot of sweat, and the clothes should be replaced in time after being sweated. Cold and aggravated the condition.\n5. Physical cooling\nPediatric epidemic cold drug\nBaby heat should prefer physical cooling, especially small baby fever. When the physical cooling is invalid, the drug temperature is carried out in a small amount of antipyretics. Physical cooling methods are: local heat dissipation, water temperature, water bath or warm water bath, cold saline enema, etc.\nPartial heat dissipation cooling method\nHead cold coating or head ice bag: This is the most common method. In the head cold wet (i.e., the amount of the cold wet towel is applied to the baby) The acceptance is the highest, some babies are reluctant to put the ice bag in the head, and can be used in cold humidity. Pay attention to frequent replacement of ice bags or cold wet towels. Neck, underarms and belts of the Ice bags: these parts have a relatively large blood vessel, put the ice bag in these places to cool down. Wash the temperature shower or warm water bath: It can be received with a good cooling effect, but it is difficult to implement in winter.\nExperts remind: to closely observe the changes in the baby, pay attention to the fever, pay attention to the ambissions, and be wary of high fever. There have been high-fenced babies, to take \"Rimmy\" under the guidance of a doctor, and prevent high fee survey again. If you find that there is a herpes or rash on the skin, you need to see your doctor in time.",
    "cause": "80% ~ 90% of the cold is caused by viruses, more than 200 viruses causing a cold; 10% to 20% of colds are caused by bacteria. Baby within 1 year old is more prone to colds because the immune system has not yet matured.\nChildren are prone to colds, first with their mechanics, anatomical characteristics, immune system development immune system. The child's nasal stenosis, soft mucosa, insufficient mucosa secretion, dry dry, poorly adapted to the outside environment and resistance, and is prone to inflammation. Premature infants, children with congenital defects or diseases, such as cardiopulmonary functions, especially when they have innate immunogenesis, the care is slightly mistaken.\nSecondly, it is also related to the improper feeding method of parents. Since the child grows fast, those children who take artificial feeding due to lack of breast milk, and those who are too petty, eclipse, anorexia, malnutrition or imbalance, may cause different degrees of iron , Calcium deficiency or vitamin and protein intake. Nutritional components such as iron, zinc, and protein have an important role in the synthesis of various globulins of the immune system and the promotion of immune cells.\nThird, it is related to the surrounding environment. Some children's family room conditions are poor, dark and humid; some indoor temperatures are too low; some families like to turn off the doors and windows in the end of the day, air is not flowing; some family members are hobbied, plus the room with fire, smoke pollution severe. The environment is poor, air turbidity, very harmful to the respiratory tract, is an important reason for induces a cold. Some parents gave their children too much or too, the result is not sweating, it is cold, it is easy to induce a cold.\nFinally, the cold is also related to the lack of outdoor exercise. Due to objective conditions, it is not enough attention, many children lack outdoor activities. For example, the child in northern China and the cold season, the child is at most time, very few opportunities to live in outdoor activities; some parents love children, and put their children into the air conditioning room. Once these children are cold, they cannot be adapted and have a cold.",

Dust dispersion\nThe degree of dispersion is a measure of the size of the dust particle, expressed in the percentage of various particle diameter sizes in dust. The bigger the proportion of small particles, the bigger the degree of dispersion. The dispersion size is closely related to the floating of dust particles in the air and its retaining portion in the respiratory tract. Diameter is greater than 10 um dust particles so fast in the air, even if the inhalation is also hidden by the nasal nose, the dust is discharged; the dust below 10 um, most of which is damaged by the upper respiratory tract; 5 um or less dust, can enter the alveolar; The dust below 0.5 um, due to small gravity, not easy to settle, with exhalation, so the retention rate is lowered; and the dust of <0.1 um or less due to Brown sports, the retention rate increases.\n4. Body status\nHuman respiratory tract has a series of defensive devices, inhaled dust, first, when the nasal hair is formed, it is mainly damaged by the dust of nasal hair and the nose, which is generally 30% to 50% of the suction dust, into the trachea, bronchillary dust, great The part can be bifurcated by the bronchial tree, the mucosal skin movement is blocked and discharged with the sputum; some dust particles are swallowed by macrophage or alveolar macrophages into dust cells, dust cells or unwinding free dust particles Enter the lymph nodes along the lymphatic tube.\nAnyone who has chronic respiratory inflammation is poor, and the respiratory infection, especially the tuberculosis, which can promote the rapid progress and intensification of silicosis. In addition, individual factors such as age, health quality, personal hygiene habits, nutritional conditions, etc. are also important conditions affecting the pathogenesis of silicosis.\nPathogenesis\nAfter the free silica particles enter the alveolar, the pulmonary hypertrophy is concentrated in pulmonary lymph tank initiation site, and free silica has strong toxic effects on macrophages, which can cause self-dissolving death and dioxide. After the silicon is swallowed, it is wrapped in a phagocytic cytosoligate, and hydrogen bonds are formed between hydrogen atomic receptors (oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur atom) on the hydrogen atomic receptor (oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur atom) on the surface of the quartz surface and macrophages. Changes of changes in cell membranes and changes in permeability, resulting in macrophage lysosomas, and releases acid hydrolase into intracellular, which will cause macrophage death, and release quartz particles, form a vicious circle, resulting More cells are damaged, impaired macrophages release non-lipid \"solvent factors\", stimulating fibroblasts, resulting in collagen fiber proliferation, forming collagen-centric lesion nodules - nodules , The illegal joint is extended to the whole lung and integrates with each other, causing double lung diffuse damage. The fibrosis is not only limited to the lungs, but also in the lymph nodes migrated by macrophages, and serum \u03b3 in many silicosis patients The globulin level increases, the presence of autoantibodies, and \u03b3-globulin in silicone disease, it is proposed that the immunological mechanism of silicosis occurs, but the immune ingredient does not appear to be involved in the formation of macrophages and fibrosis, so Secondary pathogenesis.\nThe tandem joint is a characteristic lesion of silicosis. At the same time, it is accompanied by diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, and the silicon is often located around the bronchial and blood vessels, and the diameter is 0.3 to 1.5 mm. The general specimen sees the lungs, the lung is grayish, the texture is harder. The volume increases, the weight is increased, the surface is sandy or hard block, the cross section can be seen, the real world is clear, the texture is dense, and the lung tissue is visible in the nodule, usually all the pulmonary diffuse Distribution, local lymph nominals of the thoraculation and external lymph nominals, calcification or formation of \u7ed3.\nThe microscope is shown in a circular or star malavine, and the center is composed of collagen fibers that have occurred in glass samples. The collagen fibers are arranged in concentric circles, and there are different ratios around methylene circles. There are different proportions around merger, macrophages, fibrous fibers. Cells and slurry cells are wrapped around, similar to hunque, gain, and then active, and polarized microscopy can identify the quartz particles deposited in the lung tissue with a polarized microscope.\nThe lymph nodes of the lungs are the earliest part of the, and it can have the lymph node before the chest ends have not seen the illegal knot, and the general specimen shows that lymphatic soda is large, adhesion, histological performance is similar to the lungs, visible in lymph Dispersive non-nestal granuloma, as the disease progresses, similar fibrosis changes, lymph nodes can be changed from the change in lung tissue during typical silicon and severe interstitial fibrosis.",

    "cause": "The essence of suffocation is hypoxia. Any factor that can cause fetal or newborns can cause suffocation. A cause can affect the body through different pathways, and multiple diseases can be used, and neonatal suffocation is Or the birth time factor, less postpartum factors, common causes are as follows:\n(1) Pregnant hypoxic diseases: such as respiratory failure, congenital heart disease, severe anemia and CO poisoning.\n(2) Diseases of placenta cycle barriers: such as congestive heart failure, pregnancy hypertension syndrome, chronic nephritis, blood loss, shock, diabetes and infectious diseases.\n(3) Other: Pregnant amnesthesia, smoking, smoking or passive smoking, or pregnant mymest age \u2265 35 years old, <16 years old and multi-pregnancy, etc.\n(1) Premature birth: premature infants, less than the fetal age, huge children, etc.\n(2) Deformity: Various malformed nostrils, laryngeal, lung expansion, congenital heart disease and intrauterine infection caused by damage.\n(3) Respiratory blocker: fetal suction causes respiratory obstruction or the like.\nSuch as front placenta, placental early stripping and placenta functionality.\nSuch as umbilical cords are pressed, too short, too long, neck or wind, prolapse, twist or knotted.\nSuch as difficulty, high-level pliers, buttocks, fetal head attracting unsuccessful; in the production process, analgesics, analgesic and oxytocid use improper use.\nPathogenesis\nA series of pathophysiological changes occur due to various etiology caused by suffocation:\n1. Cell damage after asphyxia, hypoxia can lead to cell metabolism and dysfunction and structural abnormalities, and even death, and are cell damage from reversible to irreversible evolution, and different cells have different susceptibility to hypoxia. The most sensitive Secondly, the myocardium, liver and adrenal cells, while fiber, epithelial and skeletal muscle cells have high tolerance to hypoxia.\n(1) Reparalectable cell damage: The energy required for cells is mainly supplied by the ATP generated by mitochondrial, and hypoxia is first in the cellular oxygen metabolism, and the oxychirates in the mitochondria, so that the ATP is reduced or even stopped, due to the lack of energy, Oxygen, leading to cell metabolism, function and form abnormalities:\n1 Glucose anoxic yeast enhancement: no oxygen detergent increases glucose and glycogen consumption, which is prone to hypoglycemia; it also increases lactic acid, causing metabolic acidosis.\n2 cell edema: due to energy lack of energy, sodium pump proactive transfer disorder, so that sodium, water retention.\n3 Calcium stream in intracellularity: due to the obstacle of the calcium pump, it is increased to the flow of calcium to the cells.\n4 nuclear protein falling off: Due to the fallback of the nucleophyte from the crude endicular network, the synthesis of proteins and enzymes is reduced, and this stage can restore blood flow perfusion and oxygen, the above variation can be completely recovered, generally no sequelae.\n(2) Inseparable cell injury: long or severe hypoxia will result in irreversible cell damage.\n1 Severe mitochondrial morphology and function is abnormal: oxidized phosphorylation, ATP is disorder, and the mitochondrial production capacity is interrupted.\n2 severe damage of cell membrane: loss of its barrier and transport function.\n3 lysosomas rupture: due to dissolution membrane injury, lysosome enzyme diffuse into cytoplasm, digestion in the cellular components (self-satisfaction), even if blood flow perfusion and oxygen is restored, the above variation is not completely recovered. The survivors have left different degrees of sequelae.\n(3) Hematic reperfusion injury: After recovery, blood flow reperfusion can result in increased cellular calcium overload and oxygen free radicals, thereby causing further damage of cells.\n2. Ascending development process\n(1) Primary apnea: When the fetus or neonatal hypoxemia occurs, high-carbonate and acidosis, due to increased catecholamine secretion, breathing and heart rate increase, the blood flow is re-distributed Selective vascular contraction, make the secondary tissue and organs such as blood flow such as lung, intestine, kidney, muscle, skin, and the main life organs such as brain, myocardium, myocardium, the blood flow increased, the blood pressure increase, increased heart output Such as hypoxemia and acidosis continue to present, breathing stop, called primary apnea.\n(2) Secondary Apnea: If the cause is not released, hypoxemia persisted, lung, intestinal, kidney, muscle and skin flow is severely reduced, brain, myocardial and adrenal blood flow also reduces It can cause various organ functions and morphological damage, such as brain and myocardial injury, shock, shoulder ulcers, etc. Respiratory is suspended.\nThe performance of the two apnea is no breathing and heart rate less than 100 times / min, so it is difficult to identify, in order to prevent rescue timing, there is no breathing person after the launch of the life should be suspended and processed.\n3. Blood biochemical and metabolic changes after asphyxia, increased catecholamine and glucagon release, so that early blood sugar is normal or increased; when the oxygen is continuous, the sugar is increased, the glycogen is stored empty, hypoglycemia In addition to the increase of fatty acids, promoting calcium ions and proteins to cause hypocalocalocalocalocyhemia, and acidosis inhibits bilirubin and albumin, reducing the vitality of liver enzymes and causes high indirect gallbladder; due to left The secretion of the heart is increased, resulting in low sodama.",

    "cause": "(1) Thunder motion disorder: the abnormality of nerve, muscle and bones, such as brain, spinal cord gray, multiple nerveitis, spinal muscle atrophy, severe muscle weakness and skeletal deformity (\u4f5d\u507b \u4f5d\u507b, funnel chest, spinal bend) Wait.\n(2) Diaphragm motility: due to the increase in the paralysis or intraperitoneal pressure, it is often caused by a large amount of ascites caused by various reasons.\n(3) Pulmonary expansion: Due to the decrease or pressure increase in the chest, such as the thoracic fluid, gas, suppurate, blood chest, chyle, tension pneumothorax, diaphragm, tumor and heart increase.\n(4) The bronchial is oppressed: due to the swelling lymph nodes, tumors or cysts, the bronchoal tube cavity is blocked, and the air cannot enter the lung tissue, and the expanded left atrial and pulmonary artery compressive left bronchi causes left lungs.\n(1) foreign matter: foreign matter blocked bronchial or fine branch of airborne or lung neutral lungs, occasional foreign matter blocked air pipe or main branch trachea caused bilateral or one side of the lung.\n(2) Bronchial lesions: bronchial mucosa under tuberculosis, tuberculosis granuuli tissue, diphtheria pseudo film extension tracheal and bronchi.\n(3) Bronchial wall spasm and intra-lumen viscous secretion: the infant's respiratory tract is small, easy to block, pneumatic inflammatory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, hundred-day cough, measles, etc., etc., the bronchial mucosa Swelling, smooth muscle spasm, viscous secretion can block the respiratory tract, causing the lungs, such illnesses are more common in winter and spring, so that the pathogenesis of the lung is also in the cold season, cough drugs such as opioids, Atrine can reduce nature Cough, but also make the secretions, can increase obstruction, so it is not abused.\nWhen spinal spinal gray, the diaphragm and chest muscles are low or paralyzed, and the bronchial secretions are not easy to cough, and the thoracic surgery is long-term systemic anesthesia, deep anesthesia or traumatic shock, due to stimulation caused bronchial Spasm, the bronchial secretion has increased, such as cough reflection is suppressed or disappeared, the secretion is more susceptible to block the lumen, causing the lungs.\nWhen capillary bronchitis, interstitial pneumonia and bronchial asthma, often causes the obstruction of most fine branch tracheal, in the early stage of obstructive emphysema, and thereafter, some complete obstruction, forming a lung, and the emphysema exists.\nThe formation of obstructive lungs can be elucidated according to the result of direct inspection of bronchoscopy.\n(1) Surfactant lack: The lung surface active substance is generated from type II vermurulum epithelial cells, which is a phospholipid protein composite. It is a mainly two-brown-brown-absorbing phospholipid, and the surface active material is discharged in alveolar. Inside, there is a function of reducing the surface tension of the alveolar-liquid cross-bound surface, there is a function of stabilizing alveolar preventing alveolar plug, if the surface active substance is lacking, the tension of the alveolar surface is increased, the alveolar retransmission force increases, the alveolar is gumped, resulting Many miniature lungs do not open (microatelectasis), the lack of active substances in the lung surface can be found in:\n1 Premature infants are immature.\n2 Bronchin pneumonia, especially viral pneumonia, is reduced in surface active substances.\n3 wound, shock, etc., excessive ventilation, rapidly consumed surface active substance.\n4 Inhalation of gas or pulmonary edema, such as surface active material damage, normal pulmonary surface tension is 6 dacco / cm, while the surface active substance is lacking, the surface tension of breathing evanhaust infants can reach 23 dacco / cm.\n(2) Another non-blocking lungs may not be related to the neuromuscular structure of the pulmonary end airway: many scholars have confirmed, away from the airway until the alveolar tube and the pulmonary sac are muscles, and the smooth muscle and elastic fibers are interleaved. Together, it is controlled by plant nerve, when pain, like rib fracture and surgery, or bronchial is strongly stimulated such as bronchial angiography, muscle bomb fiber contraction can cause lungs, especially large lungs.\n(3) The breathing is too shallow: after surgery and the application of morphine, or the coma and extremely weak patients can see the breath shallow measuring, when the lung pressure is reduced to insufficient to resist local surface tension, it can gradually cause alveolar closure and lungs. Zhang, encourage the patient's deep breath to prevent alveolar from closing, or reopen the alveolar closes due to the shallowness of the breath.\nIn short, the lungs do not open the number of children in the child, and the disease is more common due to capillary bronchitis, bronchitis, asthma, bronchial lymphatic finisher, multiple nerveitis, bronchi foreign matter and surgery, in addition, it can be found in inhalation Pneumonia, bronchial expansion, intracranial hemorrhage, endocardial elastic fiber hyperplasia, congenital heart disease, tumor, etc.",

The research work pointed out that the role of secretion IgA against respiratory infection is better than any serum antibody, which is very effective due to too many types of intestinal viruses and nasal viruses.",
    "cause": "80% ~ 90% of the cold is caused by viruses, more than 200 viruses causing a cold; 10% to 20% of colds are caused by bacteria. Baby within 1 year old is more prone to colds because the immune system has not yet matured.\nThe child's nasal stenosis, soft mucosa, insufficient mucosa secretion, dry dry, poorly adapted to the outside environment and resistance, and is prone to inflammation. Premature infants, children with congenital defects or diseases, such as cardiopulmonary functions, especially when they have innate immunogenesis, the care is slightly mistaken.\nA result of 157 parents' nutritional knowledge and surveys, those who know general parenting knowledge account for only 10.2%. Since the child grows fast, children who take artificial feeding due to lack of breasts, and those who are too petty, eclipse, anorexia, malnutrition or imbalance, may cause different degrees of iron deficiency, calcium deficiency or vitamin and protein intake . Nutritional components such as iron, zinc, and protein have an important role in the synthesis of various globulins of the immune system and the promotion of immune cells. The body lacks vitamin A, resulting in reduced respiratory epithelial cells, disappears, glandular loss normal function, lysozyme and secretion of immune antibody significantly reduced, barrier function reduction, can cause infection. Insufficient calcium intake can cause pediatric disease, resulting in low resistance, virus, bacterial infection. Low calcium can lead to weakening the angioplasmic cells of the respiratory tract, so that the breathing tract secretion is not easy to discharge. These are the causes of the cold.\nSome children's family room conditions are poor, dark and humid; some indoor temperatures are too low; some families like to turn off the doors and windows in the end of the day, air is not flowing; some family members are hobbied, plus the room with fire, smoke pollution severe. The environment is poor, air turbidity, very harmful to the respiratory tract, is an important reason for induces a cold. Some parents gave their children too much or too, the result is not sweating, it is cold, it is easy to induce a cold.\nDue to objective conditions, it is not enough attention, many children lack outdoor activities. For example, in the northern and cold season, the child is in the room, and there are very few opportunities to act in outdoor activities. Some parents love their children, and children into the air-conditioned room. Once these children are cold, they cannot be adapted and have a cold.",

For example:\n2, should not be in indoor feeding cats, dogs and other small animals.\n3, usually pay attention to exercise, such as cold water bath, dry towel, etc., so that the tension of the vagus nerve of the pulmonary, trachea, bronchi is alive.\n4, balanced nutrition, avoid mental stimulation, avoiding colds and excessive fatigue, etc. also have an important role in preventing asthma.\nhealth education:\n1. Psychological guidance: Guide patients to treat asthma correctly, establish confidence in victory diseases, so that patients can clear the asthma can not be removed, but can be fully controlled. Explain the relationship between psychological factors such as mental emotions and asthma attacks, so that patients maintain a good mentality to avoid fear.\n2, diet guidance: The diet of asthma patients should be light and easy to digest. At the same time, pay attention to some foods such as seafood, especially shrimp, can induce asthma, but also pay attention to avoid, and some foods such as almonds, peanuts and other nuts may also induce asthma attack, need to avoid avoidance.\n3, environmental factors: Due to the reactive primation of asthma and the environment, minimize the sensitizal in the environment, such as maintaining indoor air flow, avoid dust, pollen, gas, smoke and other stimulating substances. Avoid contacting dust mites, fungi, fur, food, drugs, etc., outdoor air to reduce pollution, avoid out or wear masks in dust weather.\n4. Guidance of medication: Normative use drug is a premise and foundation for effective treatment. Due to the genetic inheritance of asthma, asthma cannot be cured, the treatment of asthma is basically lifelong, and the medication must be carried out under the guidance of a doctor, avoiding free stop.\n5. Church patients use peak flow versators to monitor asthma treatment, and guide asthma patients to remember asthma diary.\n6. Guide patients' physical exercise: appropriate activities such as walking, playing Taiji, etc., not only can exercise, but also exercise lung function. However, for patients with sportswell, exercise may induce asthma attacks, need attention.",
    "cause": "Asthma is a disease that occurs through environmental factors based on genetic susceptibility. Genetically susceptibility involves multiple genes and their interactions, and the environmental factors of pathogenicity are also varied.\nGenetic this is the most important host factor. There is no known gene to exist in two or more studies, which means that the interaction between genes may be more important, and it is again confirmed the polymeric genetic characteristics of asthma. In addition, the target of the drug action, such as \u03b22 receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, etc. also also research hotspots, but the abnormality of these genes may not only be related to the incidence, but also related to therapeutic effect.\nObesity is an independent risk factor of asthma, especially for women. Obesity asthma patients are more difficult. Possible mechanism: 1, change the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. 2, adipose tissue release IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, eosinophil chemokine (eotaxin), leptin, and other inflammatory factors, so that the immune function is presented to promote inflammatory tendency. 3, obesity is also a centralized reflection of the body in genetically, developing, endocrine, and neuromed, these defects may also be the cause of asthma.\n1. Inhalation allergens are the cause of asthma, this point of view is widely accepted. Dustocatophagoides sp.) Is the most common inhalation allergen induced by asthma. Pollen, dolphin, fungus spore-induced asthma often has seasonal characteristics. When you start a storm, you often raise a lot of pollen, which may cause many asthma patients simultaneously, called \"Thunderstorm Astma). Alternatively, the allergens in the environment can lead to chronic persistent symptoms in patients, such allergens come from home pet fraud, cockroaches, dust, etc.\n2. The relationship between allergens and asthma is more complicated, may be affected by the type of allergens, the exposure dose, the exposure time, the age of the host, and the genetic characteristics of the host, sometimes, early contact allergy It can be induced by immune tolerance, but it has protective effects. In addition, it is strictly avoided that exposure to allergens fail to reduce the risk of asthma.\n1. Interior and after birth contact with smoking smoke, increase the risk of asthma symptoms in children.\n2. Smoking has a serious negative impact on asthma patients: which can lead to frequent accepted asthma, the lung function recession is accelerated, the condition is more serious, the inpatient rate increases, and the role of leather hormones is higher. Inflammatory response in the presence of neutral granulocytes in the airway of asthma patients in asthma, which is different from general asthma.\n1, air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, ozone, can induce asthma attack.\n2. The effect of air pollutants on the prevalence of asthma is still not determined. The city has been contaminated with a serious contaminated city and has not found the rise in asthma.",

    "desc": "Bronchialasthma, referred to as asthma, is a reversible respiratory respiratory, and has a highly reactive respiratory inversion, and has a highly reactive respiratory, obstructive respiratory disease. It is a common chronic respiratory disease that seriously hazards children's health. The incidence is high, and the chronic course of incidence is repeatedly affected, which seriously affects the learning, life and activities of children, affecting the growth and development of children's adolescents. Many children's asthma patients have been delayed due to injustice or improper treatment, and ultimately develop as adult asthma. Dictation of lung function is damaged, and some patients even completely lose physical labor. Severe asthma attacks, if it is not obtained in time, you can be fatal. For asthma definition, etiology, pathogenesis, immunology, pathophysiology and diagnosis and treatment principles, children are basically similar to adults. However, children and adult asthma still have different differences in certain aspects. Asthma children are in intelligence, physical, psychological and immune systems, etc., which are constantly growing, especially in terms of immunity and pathophysiology, and children have their own specializes.",

    "cause": "(1) Causes of the disease\nThe incidence of asthma around the world is between 0.1% and 32%, which is close to 300 times, which may be related to genetic gene, age, geographic location, climate, environment, race, industrialization, urbanization, interior decoration, living standard, and diet. Habits, etc.\nThe factors induce bronchial asthma are multifaceted, and common factors are as follows:\nAllergic substances are roughly divided into three categories:\n1 Causes infected pathogens and their toxins, pediatric asthma sects and respiratory infections are closely related, and more than 95% of infants and young children are due to respiratory tract infections, main pathogens are respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytic viruses (RSV), adenovirus , Influenza virus, subfluenza virus, etc. It has been shown that respiratory syncytial viral infection can cause wheezing due to a specific IgE-mediated type I metamorphosis, and other local infections such as sinusitis, tonsillitis, and dental caries may also be induced.\n2 Inhalation: Usually inhalation of the respiratory tract, domestic skin test shows that the most important source of asthma is the most important source of dust, dust, mold, multivalent pollen (artemisia, dolphin), feathers, etc. There is also a report that contact silk throws asthma, especially the mites as inhalation allergen, and places a certain important position in respiratory metamorphosis reactive diseases. Childhood allergies are more than adults, spring and autumn is the most suitable season of survival. Therefore, dust mite asthma is good in spring and autumn, and the patient is more common. In addition, inhalation alterations, the asthma episodes are often related to the season, regional and living environments. Once they stop contact, symptoms can be reduced or disappeared.\n3 food: mainly for allogeneic proteins, such as milk, eggs, fish shrimp, spices, etc. Food allergy is common in infancy, and gradually decreases after 4 ~ 5 years.\nNon-specific stimulators (20%):\nSuch as dust, smoke (including cigarettes and mosquito fragrance), odor (industrial irritating gas, cooking oil and oil odor, etc.) Cough and bronchospasm. Sometimes inhaling cold air can also induce bronchospasm. Some scholars believe that air pollution is increasingly serious, or one of the increasing causes of bronchial asthma.\nChildren patients are very sensitive to climate change, such as the temperature suddenly getting cold or decreased by air pressure, often induced asthma attack. Therefore, in general, children in the spring and autumn have increased significantly.\nIn asthma in children, the spiritual factors cause asthma attacks, but the asthma children are often affected, such as crying laughing or impulse, can cause asthma attack after fear. Some scholars have confirmed that they often accompany the vagus of vagueism when emotional excitement or other psychological activity.\nAsthma has hereditary, family-friendly family and personal allergy history, such as asthma, baby eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, etc., is higher than that of general groups.\nAbroad reports about 90% of asthmatic, often stimulating asthma, also known as Exercise Induced Astma, EIA, more common in large children. Dramatic continued (5-10 minutes), it is most likely to induce asthma after running.\nAsthma caused by drugs is also more common. There are mainly two types of drugs, and one is aspirin and similar antipyretic impersonation, which can cause so-called endogenous asthma. As with sinusitis and nasal polyps, it is called Aspirin triasis, and other similar drugs have anti-inflammatory pain, methic acid. The mechanism of causing asthma may inhibit prostaglandin synthesis for Aspirin, resulting in a reduction in CAMP content, and release chemical media causes asthma. Such asthma is often reduced with age, and there is a decrease in adolescence after adolescence; another type of drug is a drug that acts on the heart, such as the heart, the degree of experience can block the beta receptor and cause asthma, and many spray inhalers can also be due to Stimulating throat reflectivity causes bronchospasm, such as sodium chromatarrate, easy purity, etc., other iodine production, sulfamine allergies often can also induce asthma.\n(2) pathogenesis\nBronchial asthma is a multi-factor caused complex disease, and the pathogenesis is still unknown. The currently recognized mechanism has the following three aspects.\n1, type I metamorphosis reaction and IgE synthesis regulatory disorder\nAfter the antigen (alteration) first enters the human body, it acts on B lymphocytes to make it a slurry cell to produce IgE, IgE adsorbed on hypertrophy cells or basophils, and its Fc segment and cell membrane surface are binding The IgE is firmly adsorbed on the cell membrane, causing the body to be inactive, when the corresponding antigen enters the sensitizer, i.e., adsorbed on the combination of the Mermatic cell and the base granules, resulting in cell membrane deprotecting, release a series of chemicals Media includes histamine, slow reactive substances, combinity peptides, 5-hydroxyamine and prostaglandins, etc., these biologically active substances can cause biological effects such as capillary expansion, permeability, smooth muscle spasm and hyperthyroidism, and cause bronchial asthma.\nIn recent years, many studies have shown that the increase in IgE is related to cellular immune dysfunction, and a large number of studies have shown that T cells are not only changed, and there may be functional defects, and the high IgE may also be related to inhibitory T cells.\n2, airway inflammation changes\nThe asthma model and asthma patients were biopsy via fibrous bronchoscopy and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL), which proved that the airway tissue showed different degrees of inflammatory changes.\n3. Highly reactiveness of airway\nThe high reaction of the airway is an abnormal reactivity of the airway to various specific or non-specific stimulation, and the asthma is highly reactive, the airway is high, and the Type I metamorphosis reaction), and continuous reactions. At present, the high response of sustained airway is mainly related to airway inflammation, and the mechanism of high-reacted high reactions in inflammation is mainly related to inflammatory mediators. The study found that the reactivity of the aperture of histamine and acetylcholine and the severity of children with asthma were parallel. These are related to nerve regulatory disorders, especially phytosis.\nIt is known that bronchial smooth muscle is subject to sympathetic nerve and sub-integration nerve, and maintains dynamic balance under the regulation of brain-lower rock-pituitary. Normal human bronchial smooth muscle tension depends on the excitement of cholinergic receptors. The asthma is not the case, its deputy-intensive nerve tension increases, \u03b1-adrenergic neurological activity, \u03b2 adrenergic nerve function is low or partially blocked. Because of these abnormalities, the hyperthyroidism of asthma is a pathophysiological basis of asthma episode.\nThe main pathological changes of asthma are bronchial smooth muscle spasm, inflammatory cell infiltration, upper base film thickening and airway mucosal edema, epithelial fallfall mixed cellula, mucus secretion, mucosa membrane function disorder, thereby causing bronchial mucosa hypertrophy and bronchial Mucy plug. The results of the above pathological changes have caused the airway cavity, resulting in an increase in airway resistance and asthma.",

However, These children may be bleeding in the brain, which causes apnea, not due to inconsistent apnea.\n1. Actively correct hypoxemia to use mask to oxygen oxygen, the lower edge of the mask should be placed in the hood, such as putting the breathing suspension of the trachea under the \u988f; the blood oxygen partial pressure is maintained at 6.65 ~ 9.31kpa ( 50 ~ 70mmHg), reduce apnea suspension; avoid excessive ventilation of mechanical respiration, due to the consequence of unnecessary excessive ventilation, will affect the sensitivity of the respiratory center, thereby causing apnea, at which time to reduce the machine The amount of breathing is percentage of ventilation, making PACO2 gradually increases, and clinically low-blooded patients or metabolic acid poisoning combined with dispensable respiratory alkali poisoning.\n2. Actively prevent all kinds of newborn disease neonatal suffering from sepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, arterial catheter open or necrotic small intestine intestinal colitis, can inhibit the respiratory center, respiratory suspension, drug treatment, respiratory suspension is often invalid, need to use Mechanical assistance.",
    "cause": "(1) Causes of the disease\n1. Primary - premature infants are simply caused by respiratory central development;\n2, symptoms\n(1) Hypoxia: asphyxia, pneumonia, pulmonary transparent membrane disease, congenital heart disease and anemia, etc .;\n(2) Infection: sepsis, meningitis, etc .;\n(3) Central nervous system disease: intraventricular hemorrhage and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy;\n(4) The ambient temperature is too high or too low;\n(5) Metabolic disorders: hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia, hypocaldermia, etc.;\n(6) Stomach, esophageal return, necrotic coloreal colitis;\n(7) Because of the excessive aberration of the neck, the breathing is suspended in premature infants, and the incidence rate can be as high as 50% ~ 60%, the smaller the pregnancy, the higher the incidence.\n(2) pathogenesis\nMany clinical phenomena are related to neonatal apnea, some of which may be the cause of apnea, an important feature of various apnea is that when they happen to newborns, the episode of breathing is usually frequent and continuous. Newborn newborn often can find some cause, repeated breathing suspension of premature infants has no obvious lesions. Some people have proposed some mechanisms to explain the occurrence of newborns, in central nerve regulation, peripheral respiratory muscle movement, and Maintaining a smooth respiratory tract so that the gas exchange has a fine balance, and if this balance is broken, it can cause apnea.\nThe immature of the development of the brain dry respiratory is the key to the respiratory suspension. When the hub and mixed apnea are suspended, the breathing hub is reduced to the output of each breathing muscle, and the breathing is from the sinus nodules. The electrophysiological activity of the spinal cord mesh activity system is very important for maintaining the impulse impulse of the nerve rhythm of breathing, from the upper (cortical activity) and the incoming impulse of the lower level (peripheral neurotactor, reflection arc). This neural connection can be excited or inhibitory, many neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory secretions such as endorphin, prostaglandin and adenosine can inhibit the activity of the respiratory central, but become age growth. Not that important, the output of the breathing center is the comprehensive and balance of the above influencing factors. In the newborns, there is a periodic change in weakness, and the respiratory suspension is the least in this cycle. It may also be the unstable performance of the respiratory regulation system, confirming the premature infants of the respiratory suspension of children with apnea, and its brain-drying time is prolonged, and this suggests that the ripe delay of the central, and supports This opinion: With the gradual maturity of the brain, the complexity of dendritic and synaptic contact increases, the stability of the central respiratory drive is improved.\nBasic chemical drivers are relatively invalid for newborns, especially in premature infants, premature infants of the premature age of 33 weeks, their ventilation and respiratory muscles have lower sensitivity, and there is a respiratory suspension of premature infants, response curves for carbon dioxide Take a row curve indicating that the reaction of the ventilation increases is not large, but the sensitivity to carbon dioxide is increased with the age of birth and the birth of carbon dioxide, and the hypoxia is short-lived. Insufficient and sometimes respiratory suspension, in addition, hypoxia has reduced the reactivity of premature babies to carbon dioxide, which explains why breathing is suspended, and it does not be terminated quickly by hypoxia or high carbonate. This is also the cause of oxygen to improve critical hypoxemia, or transit red blood cells to treat anemia can reduce apnea.\nThe excessive activity of the respiratory reflection in the neonatal period is also an important factor in respiratory suspension attacks. It has a large number of nerve tip receptors in the nasal wall, nasopharyngeal, or the throat, which can react to various chemical and mechanical stimulation. , Negative pressure attracts or inserts nasal feeding pipe to trioxual walls, often induce apnea and reflective tachycardia, secretions, liquids or stomach contents accumulate in the throat can induce apnea, with age and development The centralization of these highly reactive inhibitory capabilities is enhanced.\nThoracic respiratory muscle (diaphragmus and coil muscle) and the upper respiratory tract (pharyngeal, throat) muscles open by maintaining airway can result in invalid ventilation, pharyngeal airway due to lack internal hard support, In the neck, the mandible is moved and the mandible is moved, and when the tongue is pressed, when the diaphragm shrinkage produces the negative pressure of the pharyngeal, exacerbated the shutdown of the airway, the collapsed airway wall hinders the airway due to the adhesion of the mucus Renewable, relieve the airway obstruction requirement airway to expand my muscle, such as the contraction or stretching of the airway, in the inhalation process, before the diaphragm contraction, the upper airway breathing muscle is superpolar, this pair of peak airflow When passing, the upper airway resistance is passed, it is important to promote ventilation. For high-caric acid stimulation, the upper airway breathing muscle is a curve reaction, and only a little increase in the initial increase, only in high carbon dioxide levels, the opposite, the diaphragmatic The reaction of high carbonic acid is shown as a proportion or approximate straight line, therefore, if the above airway respiratory muscle does not respond, the reaction is small or slow, and the reaction of the thoracic muscle is sensitive, which is the line up, this is not Coordination can lead to instability of the upper airway, a partial or complete airway blocking, which can induce a pneumatic infarction after the central respiratory suspension, and can explain why short breathing suspension, mostly central, and The longer breathing is mixed.\nThe tractor of the thoracic and lungs put the thoracic expansion and the degree of lung inflation, passes through the distortion of the nerve to the center, and the strength and time of the breathing are adjusted, and the increase in lung capacity, strong pulmonary transition reflection (HERING-BREUER reflection) An action, that is, inhalation, extending exhalation; but increases this reflection with maturity, in contrast, the exhalation time is shortened to maintain lung capacity, and this increase is blocked The ability to duration of the inhalation movement is a compensatory mechanism to alleviate airway occlusion, and the adveneous fertile premature infants with breathing is significantly longer than the premature infants with breathing. It is suggested that the respiratory reflection is matched, the stronger the reaction ability of the blocking.\nThe breathing of newborns is significantly subject to sleep, and in premature infants' fast-moving eye (REM) dynamic sleep dominance, and may be related to brain development, respiratory suspension is more often in REM sleep, at this time, the amount of tide and respiratory frequency at this time Obvious irregularities, in addition to strong central respiratory regulation inhibition in REM sleep, there are still inhibition of intercostal muscle movement, and when the intercostal muscles are not exercise, the diaphragm is contracted, and the result is a chest deformation (contradiction breathing), Resulting in invalid ventilation and reduces lung capacity, the diaphragmatic movement compensatory, can cause the diaphragm muscle fatigue and the upper airway, the thoracic deformation can also cause the intercostatic - inhibitory reflection, limit the impulse of the phrenic nerve, the final result is possible Respiratory is suspended.\nIn short, neonates, especially premature infants, is prone to respiratory suspension is due to immature respiratory central development, easy to cause respiratory regulation disorders, newborns respiratory anatomical structural development is imperfect, physiological function is unstable, physiological information cannot be passed correctly, thus breathing rhythm The cyclical respiratory and apnea have a total of pathological physiological basis, and the apnea is further developed on the pathological basis of cyclical respiratory. The respiratory disorder is present in the respiratory center, the central chemical susceptor, the surrounding chemostat and the lung reflection, may be multiple Factors work, breathing suspended infant respiratory regulation center is in inhibitory state, such babies have small tide, low alveolar vent, PACO2 in alveolar, and have less pressure in the esophagus, and Paco2 is increased, and the ventilation reaction is poor, performance Respiratory central development is immature, and there is weak impulse, which is related to the poor function of the central nervous system.\nNeonatal apnea can be caused by hypoxia, and hypoxia can inhibit the physiological function of neonatal respiratory central, and can reduce the reaction of newborns to CO2, and the baby's hypoxia is more severe, and the CO2 is more than adult. In contrast, except for other oxygen, such as body temperature changes, hypoglycemia, acid poisoning, etc., can inhibit the respiratory hub, causing apnea.\nIn addition, the pile of respiratory secretions and the bronchial wall mucosa are swollen, and the resistance of the respiratory tract is increased, and even a certain degree of airway obstruction, it is necessary to increase the breathing function to compensate, the compensation ability of neonatal respiratory work is very poor, when the breathing load increases When it is not possible to effectively extend the inhalation time, change the esophagus pressure and increase effective elasticity, which is not perfect for this respiratory reflection. It is one of the reasons why the neonatal respiratory disease is suspended.",
