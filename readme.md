# Health Care Chatbot using Knowledge graphs + Text classification. 

Knowledge graphs combine characteristics of several data management paradigms:

Database, because the data can be explored via structured queries;
Graph, because they can be analyzed as any other network data structure;
Knowledge base, because they bear formal semantics, which can be used to interpret the data and infer new facts.

## Here, Knowledge graphs are created using GraphQL (like SQL) on **neo4j** platform.

## Python wrapper (py2neo) for connecting graph database is used. 
The python wrapper of neo4j is used to create the knowledge graph with specified nodes & relationships.
> The GraphQL queries returns the data demanded from the node or relationship
