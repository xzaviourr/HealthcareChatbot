After the treatment of vaporial alveolar lavage, its alveolar macrophage viabilityIt can be increased, and the study did not find that II cell generated protein increased, and the whole body lipid metabolism has no abnormalities, so it is generally considered that the disease is related to the decline in clearing capacity.\n",
